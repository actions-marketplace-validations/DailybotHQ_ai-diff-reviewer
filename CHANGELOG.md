## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [2.3.1] — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **A review that said `approve` could ship with a red check.** The strictness
  gate was evaluated *after* the review had been posted, so the model's
  `Recommendation:` line — written before the runtime knew the outcome — could
  contradict the check. `compute_check_gate()` is now the single decision
  point, evaluated before the review is posted: the review body, the tracking
  comment's `**Strictness gate:**` line and the exit code all derive from one
  call. Every review body now ends with a runtime-written
  `> **Check status: ✅ passing | 🚫 failing**` block, and a model
  `Recommendation: approve` is rewritten to `request-changes` whenever the
  gate is failing.
- **Under `advisory`, a fixed finding could hold the check red forever.**
  `prior-findings-resolution: advisory` retires a prior finding only when a
  maintainer resolves its thread — but `collapse-previous: true` (the default)
  minimizes those threads on the next push, removing the only escape. An
  outstanding `critical` therefore gated every subsequent round even after a
  real fix. `advisory` now applies the same corroboration test as `verified`
  (model reported `resolved` **and** the fingerprint was not re-emitted this
  round **and** the file changed or is gone) when the finding's thread is
  already collapsed (`isMinimized`; an outdated-but-visible thread does not
  count, since a maintainer can still resolve it). Corroboration
  is unchanged, findings on live threads keep the strict behaviour, and
  `block-on-critical` is not weakened for new findings.
  Retirements taken this way are counted in the summary footer as
  `N auto-retired (fix corroborated; thread already collapsed)`, so a check
  that went green without human sign-off is still traceable.
  See [`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` § 14.4.1](docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md).

- **An already-stuck PR stayed stuck after upgrading.** Corroboration tested
  "file changed since the last reviewed head", so a fix that landed in an
  earlier round could never be corroborated on a later run — the delta no
  longer touched the file. Each prior finding now carries the head SHA of the
  review that posted it (`pullRequestReview.commit.oid`), and
  `compute_changed_since_raised()` diffs that SHA against HEAD (one `git diff`
  per distinct review SHA). A same-head re-run or an unrelated push after the
  fix now passes clean. Pre-2.3.1 findings keep delta-only evidence; an
  unresolvable SHA counts as no evidence, never as changed.
- **Three bad inline anchors cost every inline comment.** GitHub rejects the
  whole review with HTTP 422 when any one anchor is outside the diff, and the
  fallback dropped all of them — on one dogfood run 3 bad anchors lost all 7
  comments. `gh_submit_review_with_fallback` now parses the PR diff's hunk
  ranges and retries once with only the provably-anchorable comments (unknown
  files are kept; a truncated diff is not evidence against them), logging the
  dropped anchors by `path:line`. Summary-only remains the last resort.
- **The summary footer could disagree with the gate.** It ran a second
  reconciliation with different inputs. `run_iar_post_llm` now stores the one
  it gated on (`ReviewResult.prior_reconciliation`) and the footer reads it
  back; after a post-LLM crash the footer reports nothing as resolved, matching
  the escalated gate.
- **A retired finding could flap the check back to red.** Under `advisory` the
  auto-retired thread stays unresolved on GitHub, so it was re-read as a prior
  finding on the next round — where the delta no longer touched the fixed file,
  so corroboration failed and it re-gated. `filter_retired_prior_findings()`
  now drops fingerprints already in `resolved_fingerprints` before they reach
  the gate; a genuine regression still re-surfaces through dedup.

### Changed

- A model `Recommendation: approve` is rewritten on **every** matching line,
  not just the first.
- `PriorFinding` carries `is_minimized` (and an `is_collapsed` property that
  means minimized only);
  `fetch_prior_findings` now selects `isMinimized` on each thread's anchoring
  comment.
- `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md`, `apply-review/SKILL.md` (new **Step 2f**)
  and `setup/reference.md` state that a body recommending `approve` is not
  evidence the check passed, and that `apply-review` must read the tracking
  marker's `Highest severity` / `Strictness gate` / IAR footer before
  summarizing a review.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-09-17

### Changed

- **xAI defaults follow the benchmark.** `provider: grok` now defaults to
  `grok-4.5` (was `grok-4.3`), and the xAI tier table resolves `balanced`
  and `economy` to `grok-4.5` and `deep` to `grok-4.6`. The 2026-09-16
  benchmark ([`tests/eval/BENCHMARK-xai-2026-09-16.md`](tests/eval/BENCHMARK-xai-2026-09-16.md),
  16 in-process runs over the labelled corpus plus Grok CLI spot checks)
  measured grok-4.3 at 0 of 5 known defects in ~10 s per review (it approves
  without reviewing — confirmed live on this repo's own PR), grok-build-0.1
  at 1 of 5 with two runs that never submitted, and grok-4.5 tied with
  grok-4.6 (3 of 5, no false positives) at the same cost and a quarter of the
  wall time. There is no cheaper xAI model that still reviews, so `economy`
  is the same model as `balanced` rather than a tier that finds nothing.
  **Cost impact:** `provider: grok` with an empty `model`, and `model: economy`
  on any xAI backend, go from ~$0.07 to ~$0.4–0.75 per review through the
  CLI (≈10×) — and start finding defects. To keep the old smoke behaviour,
  pin `model: grok-4.3` explicitly.
- **Dogfood: the Grok leg is back on `balanced`** (now grok-4.5) after the
  deliberate `economy` re-test in 2.2.0 produced a 32-second, 42-token
  approval of a diff that grok-4.6 had found a real defect in.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-09-16

### Changed

- **Dogfood: the Grok leg runs on `economy` (grok-4.3) again**, deliberately, to
  re-test the cheaper tier on live PRs after the corpus run found nothing with
  it; the `balanced` tier itself stays on grok-4.6 until that re-test says
  otherwise.
- **Agent-runner retry:** a CLI that exits 0 without writing its findings
  file gets one fresh attempt before the run is posted as an incomplete
  review; both attempts' usage is reported and the summary says
  `Retried once` (`CLI_INCOMPLETE_RETRIES`).
- **Bounded CLI output capture:** stdout/stderr of agent-runner CLIs are
  drained by reader threads that keep only the last 4 MB of each stream
  (`CLI_OUTPUT_TAIL_MAX_BYTES`); large stdin prompts can no longer deadlock
  against a full stdout pipe.
- **Cursor usage telemetry (parse-or-ignore):** `provider: cursor` now runs
  with `--output-format json` and reads any `usage` object the CLI prints
  (`parse_cursor_usage`); when nothing is found the tracking comment keeps
  saying `not reported by this provider`. Not verified live in this release
  (no Cursor key in the dogfood matrix).
- **Release hygiene:** documented that a squash body quoting `[skip release]` suppresses the release (PR #51 shipped untagged), with the recovery and the commit-message rule (`docs/RELEASE_RECOVERY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

- **Releases stamp the CHANGELOG.** `auto-release.yml` now turns
  `## [Unreleased]` into `## [X.Y.Z] — date` (and opens a fresh empty
  section) in the same sync commit that bumps the skill version, via
  `.github/scripts/stamp_changelog.py` (idempotent; empty section → notice).
  v2.0.0, v2.0.1 and v2.1.0 were restored by hand in v2.1.1.
- **Dogfood: the in-process `openai` leg runs by default** whenever
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists (opt out with the repo variable
  `SELF_REVIEW_OPENAI_CHAT=false`); the repo's required checks now include
  `CLI install smoke — grok`.
- **xAI `balanced` tier now resolves to `grok-4.6`** (was `grok-4.3`; `economy`
  stays `grok-4.3`, the built-in default for `provider: grok` is unchanged).
  Measured on the labelled corpus in `tests/eval/`: through the Grok CLI,
  `grok-4.3` reported 0 of 4 known defects (and once wrote no findings
  file) while `grok-4.6` found 3 of 4 with no false positives at ~$0.5–0.85
  and 4–10 minutes per review. The repo's own Grok dogfood leg moves to
  `balanced`.
- **Review-quality harness in the tree.** `tests/eval/run_eval.py` +
  `tests/eval/corpus.json` (labelled expectations for four merged PRs) —
  offline, never posts; documented in `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

### Added

- **`prior-findings-resolution` input (`advisory` | `verified`).** Incremental
  follow-up rounds keep the v2.1.0 default: a `resolved` verdict is reported
  but a maintainer resolves the thread and the finding keeps gating. Opting
  into `verified` restores runtime-corroborated auto-resolution — the thread
  is replied to and resolved only when the fingerprint is gone **and** the
  file changed or was deleted; unverifiable claims stay open. Footer names
  the policy when it is not the default.
- **Checksum-verified installers.** New optional inputs
  `cursor-installer-sha256` and `grok-installer-sha256`: the Cursor and
  Grok install steps now download the vendor artefact to a file through
  `.github/scripts/verified_install.sh`, log its SHA-256 on every run,
  and — when a hash is configured — refuse to run an artefact whose hash
  differs. The CI smoke matrix proves the gate (right hash accepted, wrong
  hash refused). `docs/SECURITY.md § installer supply chain` states what
  a pin does and does not cover.

### Fixed

- **Empty `model` on a custom `api-base` now fails fast** (for runners that route `api-base`; `cursor`/`grok` ignore it and keep their defaults) with the expected
  value (deployment name / `glm-5.3` / `grok-4.6` / gateway id) instead of
  silently sending the runner's default vendor model to another backend
  (`resolve_model` ran before the providers' guards, which were unreachable).
- **Inherited `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`** from the workflow
  env are validated (`validate_api_base`) and logged with a WARNING before a
  CLI receives them on a default profile, and dropped when `api-base` is set.
- **Agent-runner CLIs no longer lose a review on exit:** a non-zero exit
  with a written findings file posts a partial review (footer + WARNING);
  exit 0 without a findings file posts an explicit summary-only "incomplete
  review" (observed live with the Grok CLI). An incomplete review is never
  a green review: every blocking strictness fails the check (`lenient` stays
  green by definition), the reviewed label is not stamped, `label-once`
  does not consume the label toggle, and the prior IAR state is re-embedded
  unchanged so no open finding is retired by an empty round.
- **Stale findings files are removed before the CLI runs:** a
  `.aiprr/findings.json` left by a previous step or a persistent self-hosted
  workspace can no longer be posted as this run's review.
- **`verified` resolution corroborates against this round's fingerprints**
  (surfaced, overflow and silenced findings): a re-posted issue is never
  auto-retired even when the model also claims it resolved.
- **Agent-runner output contract uses a four-backtick fence** so the escaped
  ```suggestion example inside the schema cannot end the JSON block early
  for CLIs that render the directive as Markdown.
- **`verified_install.sh` hardening:** `cursor-version` / `grok-version` must
  match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` before being used as a URL or path segment;
  `sha256sum` falls back to `shasum -a 256` and the hash compare no longer
  needs bash 4 (macOS self-hosted runners).
- **Agent-runner output contract** states the effective inline cap and shows
  an escaped suggestion-block example; the prompt's tool-substitution note
  now covers `post_inline_comment` / `submit_review` (prompt v3.1.1); the
  incremental delta's truncation notice carries the read-the-rest hint.
- **`cursor-version` now takes effect.** The vendor's installer script
  ignores version hints, so the pin was silently a no-op; a pinned version
  now installs the versioned package directly from Cursor's download host
  (same layout and symlinks as the official installer).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-16

**Theme — runners × backends, measured cost, better follow-ups.** The action keeps its six-line quick start, but every runner can now be pointed at another backend with one input (`api-base`), two runners are new (`openai` in-process, `grok` CLI), cost is controlled by a one-word tier and shaped diffs and reported per review, follow-up rounds review the actual new diff and carry outstanding findings forward, the default prompt is v3.1, and the whole new surface went through a security pass. No input was renamed or removed; empty `api-base` is byte-identical to v2.0.x. Details per area below; the local skill pack gains base-sync on `open-pr`, a runner × backend setup wizard, and descriptions that fit every host's limit.

### Added

- **`api-base` input — bring your own endpoint (the backend contract).**
  `provider` keeps naming the *runner* (who owns the review loop); the new
  optional `api-base` names the *backend* (where the model lives). The
  host is classified into an endpoint profile (`anthropic`, `openai`,
  `azure`, `xai`, `zai`, or `custom`) that carries the per-runner quirks
  (auth header style, prompt-caching flags, Codex wire API, Azure
  workarounds). Empty keeps every existing provider byte-identical.
  Values are validated before any outward call: absolute `https://` URL
  (plain `http://` for localhost only), no embedded credentials, no
  query/fragment. This entry ships the contract and the resolver
  (`EndpointProfile`, `resolve_endpoint_profile`, `validate_api_base`);
  the runners honour it in the follow-up entries below as they land.
  Ignored by `cursor` (subscription-only).
- **`anthropic` runner honours `api-base`** — Anthropic-compatible
  backends (Z.ai GLM at `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`, xAI at
  `https://api.x.ai`, or any compatible gateway). URL composed as
  `<api-base>/v1/messages`; non-Anthropic hosts receive both `x-api-key`
  and `Authorization: Bearer`; the `cache_control` breakpoint is sent only
  to `api.anthropic.com`; errors name the endpoint kind and host, never the
  key. The default profile's request is byte-identical to before (locked by
  a snapshot test). New example `examples/provider-anthropic-zai.yml`.
- **`openai` provider — OpenAI-compatible chat-completions runner.** A
  second in-process runner (zero install, bounded turns) that translates
  the Anthropic-shaped loop at the boundary: tools ↔ function tools, tool
  results ↔ `role: tool` messages, `tool_calls` ↔ `tool_use` blocks,
  `finish_reason` ↔ `stop_reason`; malformed tool arguments are surfaced
  to the model instead of crashing. Default model `gpt-5.6-luna`. With
  `api-base` the same runner covers Azure Foundry (v1 endpoint; Bearer +
  `api-key` headers; `max_completion_tokens`), xAI (`https://api.x.ai/v1`)
  and Z.ai (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`) — `max_tokens` on those.
  Shared retrying HTTP client (`_post_json_with_retries`) now backs both
  chat-completions providers. New example `examples/provider-openai.yml`.
- **`claude-code` runner honours `api-base` (Z.ai GLM — the recommended
  GLM runner; xAI Anthropic-compatible too).** On a custom backend the CLI
  receives the documented env contract (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `API_TIMEOUT_MS`, the three
  `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` aliases pinned to `model`) and `--model` is
  always passed; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set there. `model: auto` and
  Claude subscription tokens fail fast on non-Anthropic hosts. Default
  profile env/argv unchanged (snapshot tests). New example
  `examples/provider-claude-code-glm.yml`; `docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Z.ai GLM —
  recommended runner and why".
- **`codex` runner honours `api-base` (Azure Foundry / xAI / Z.ai).** A
  per-run `config.toml` is written next to `auth.json` in the isolated
  `CODEX_HOME` declaring an OpenAI-compatible Responses-API provider
  (`wire_api = "responses"`, `env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"`); Azure hosts get
  the image-generation header workaround and `image_generation = false`.
  `model` (deployment name or backend id) is required there; `--model` is
  always passed. Strings are TOML-escaped; the key never lands in the file.
  A `models.json` cloned from Codex's bundled catalog (conservative
  capabilities, no OpenAI-only tool namespaces) is written alongside and
  referenced via `model_catalog_json` — required for xAI, harmless on
  Azure; degrades to no catalog if the CLI cannot list its bundled models.
  Live-verified on Azure Foundry (Codex 0.154.0). **Known limitation:**
  Codex 0.154 always sends its freeform `apply_patch` tool
  (`tools[].type: custom`), which xAI's Responses API rejects (HTTP 422) —
  the runtime warns on `xai` / `zai` / `custom` hosts; use `provider:
  openai` or `provider: grok` for xAI. Z.ai via Codex is unverified.
- **`grok` provider — xAI Grok CLI agent-runner, modular install.** The
  official `grok` CLI runs headless inside the full review contract: rubric
  + findings schema via `--rules`, the PR diff via a private 0600
  `--prompt-file`, findings through `.aiprr/findings.json` (gating, IAR,
  cap, collapse all apply), `XAI_API_KEY` the only credential in the
  subprocess env, web search / subagents / plan mode **off by default**,
  `--output-format json` for usage telemetry. Default model `grok-4.3`.
  `action.yml` installs the CLI only when `provider: grok`, with a new
  `grok-version` pin input; `code_check.yml` smoke-tests the installer.
  New example `examples/provider-grok.yml`.
- **Model tier aliases + cost-efficient defaults matrix.** `model` accepts
  `balanced` / `economy` / `deep`, resolved per runner × backend from one
  table (`MODEL_TIER_TABLE`) and logged; empty `model` keeps the built-in
  default (no behaviour change), explicit ids pass through, Azure /
  custom hosts fail fast with guidance. The dated matrix (verified
  2026-09-16) lives in `docs/PROVIDERS.md` with rationale per row and a
  label-routed recipe. Notable verified facts: `claude-sonnet-5` ($2/$10)
  is current and cheaper than the legacy `claude-sonnet-4-6` ($3/$15)
  the built-in default still names (the run logs a hint; `model:
  balanced` opts in); `gpt-5.6-luna` ($0.20/$1.20) is cheaper than
  `gpt-5.4-mini` ($0.75/$4.50). An indicative price table
  (`INDICATIVE_PRICES_USD_PER_MTOK`) is shared with the usage telemetry.
- **`agent-max-turns` is enforced natively on `grok`** (`--max-turns`);
  other CLIs get an accurate per-provider warning (Claude Code:
  `--max-budget-usd` via `agent-extra-args`). Junk values abort.
- **Diff shaping — `ignore-paths` input + built-in generated-file
  exclusions.** Lockfiles, minified bundles, source maps, vendored trees
  (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`) and test snapshots are removed
  from the diff the model receives — **before** the 200k-char cap, so a
  huge lockfile can no longer crowd out real changes — and listed back
  under an "Omitted from the diff" block with line counts (the
  changed-files list flags them too). `ignore-paths` adds gitignore-style
  globs (`**` spans directories; a bare pattern matches basenames). Saves
  tokens on every turn. IAR's range hash and new-lines % still use raw
  git output and are unaffected.
- **Anthropic path caches the diff message too.** A second
  `cache_control` breakpoint on the first user message (added on a copy at
  the provider boundary; the in-memory conversation is untouched; sent only
  to `api.anthropic.com`) makes turns 2..N read the PR diff from cache.
  Both chat-completions providers now log a compact per-call
  `usage: in=… cache_read=… cache_write=… out=…` line.
- **Real usage telemetry and cost surfacing on every review.**
  `UsageTelemetry` is captured from the provider: API `usage` objects
  (`anthropic`, `openai`), the Claude Code stream-json `result` event
  (incl. vendor cost), Codex `--json` `turn.completed` events (the
  provider now passes `--json`), the Grok JSON document (incl. vendor
  cost); Cursor reports nothing and says so. The tracking comment gains a
  `**Usage:** 341.2k in (88% cached) · 2.1k out · est. $0.05 (indicative)
  · 6 turns · 71s` line, the run log prints the same, and the
  `iteration-tokens-used` output is real (no longer `"0"`). Cost is
  vendor-reported when available, otherwise an indicative estimate from
  the dated price table; never gate CI on it.
- **Incremental follow-up reviews.** Rounds 2+ with a trusted delta (prior
  reviewed head is an ancestor of HEAD, no escape/safety-net override, at
  least one prior finding still open) send the model only the hunks that
  changed since its last review, one-liners for the other files, and a
  table of its own still-open findings read back from the PR threads. The
  model classifies each prior finding (`update_prior_finding` tool /
  `prior_findings` array). Resolution claims are advisory until a
  maintainer resolves the thread; outstanding findings retain their
  blocking severity without duplicate comments. Inline cap and `max-turns` scale with the
  delta (floors 3 / 6; prior criticals never starve). Summary footer
  `Since last review: resolved N · still open M · regressed K · new J`;
  marker annotation `mode=incremental`. Every inline comment now carries
  a stable hidden marker `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-finding: fp=… sev=… -->`.
  Full review remains the fallback on rebase / force-push, the escape
  label, the 30 % safety net, or any error.
- **§ 13.1 closed:** the agent-runner inline cap is enforced inside the
  IAR post-LLM step after fingerprinting, so overflow findings are known
  to dedup instead of re-surfacing as new.
- **Default prompt v3.** Adds triage-first planning, a verification
  budget, a false-positive calibration list, an explicit finding shape,
  an omitted-files acknowledgement and the follow-up-review section;
  severity model, "what NOT to comment on" and summary shape are
  unchanged so extensions keep layering. Triage is explicitly decoupled
  from severity and unverified suspicions go to the summary instead of
  inline with a lowered severity; the session always ends with
  `submit_review`. The agent-runner findings directive keeps only the
  file-safety rule (no duplicated budget text). Evaluated offline
  before/after on four merged PRs with two live backends, then refined
  after a calibration review (see `docs/PROMPTS.md`). The agent-runner
  findings directive's JSON example is now valid JSON (the `// optional`
  comment that the review itself flagged is gone; the rule text below the
  example already says the field is optional).
  Default profile argv/env unchanged and no config/catalog file is
  written. New example `examples/provider-codex-azure.yml`.

### Security

- **`api-base` hardening.** Hostnames must be ASCII (internationalised
  domains only in their explicit punycode form) so a homoglyph host can
  never masquerade as a vendor domain in logs; IPv6 literals are handled
  (`http://[::1]` is a loopback exception like `localhost`). When the
  host is not a recognised vendor endpoint the run logs a WARNING naming
  the host that will receive `api-key`.
- **Bounded untrusted input from vendor CLIs.** The agent-runner findings
  file is capped at 5 MB (`MAX_FINDINGS_FILE_BYTES`; larger files are
  refused, not parsed); usage parsers already scan a bounded stdout tail.
- **`ignore-paths` cannot stall the runner.** Globs are matched by a
  backtracking-free segment matcher (`_GlobMatcher`) instead of a compiled
  regex — the regex form backtracked exponentially on patterns such as
  `*.*.*.*.ts` against a long non-matching file name, and file names are
  PR-controlled. Globs are also capped in count (200) and length (256
  characters). Semantics are unchanged (`**`, `*`, `?`, `/` anchoring,
  trailing `/`).
- **Persisted marker state cannot inject git arguments.** `base_sha` /
  `head_sha` read back from the tracking comment's `ai-pr-reviewer-state`
  JSON are accepted only as hex object ids (4–64 chars); anything else
  (e.g. `--output=/path`) becomes `""`, which disables the delta fast
  path instead of reaching `git diff` / `git merge-base` as an argv
  token. Found by the Task 13 security review of the branch.
- **Installer steps honour a pre-installed CLI.** The `cursor` and `grok`
  install steps skip the `curl | bash` installer when the binary is
  already on `PATH` (self-hosted / pre-provisioned runners can mirror the
  installer in-house). `provider: cursor` now logs a WARNING and ignores
  `api-base` instead of silently accepting it (Cursor has no
  bring-your-own-endpoint lane).
- `docs/SECURITY.md` documents the new surface: where the key goes with a
  custom endpoint, per-run generated files and their permissions, Grok's
  web-search/subagent defaults, vendor stdout as untrusted input, the
  Grok installer supply chain, and a credential-lanes table asserted by
  tests. `.review/extension.md` gains matching `critical`/`warning`
  rules for the reviewer itself.

### Fixed

- **Incremental review safety:** preserve outstanding criticals in the gate and marker state, use the actual previous-head delta before truncation, paginate prior threads, and force full review on base movement. File edits and absent fingerprints no longer auto-resolve threads.
- **Backend isolation and credential routing:** custom endpoints have separate tracking, collapse and IAR scopes; the in-process HTTP client refuses redirects, and endpoint validation rejects raw control characters.
- **Usage accounting:** include uncached input, cache reads, cache writes and output exactly once; normalize Codex cached-input subsets. Add offline safety regressions, including the one-selected-CLI installation invariant.

- **Skill descriptions fit the 1,024-character Open Agent Skills limit.**
  Pi printed `description exceeds 1024 characters (1695)` for the
  vendored skill; the parent `SKILL.md` and `apply-review/SKILL.md`
  descriptions are rewritten as compact routing summaries (the full
  trigger catalogues stay in the body) and
  `scripts/validate-frontmatter.py` now fails on descriptions over 1,024
  characters or names over 64. Downstream vendored copies clear the
  warning when they pick up the release that ships this.

### Changed
- **Dogfood follow-ups from the first self-review of the release PR.** An
  `api-base` given with a trailing `/v1` (as many vendor docs show it) no
  longer produces `/v1/v1/messages` (`join_endpoint_path`); the Grok
  installer steps carry their trust justification inline; the runtime's
  size is stated honestly (~10k LOC, historical soft ceiling crossed
  deliberately — `docs/STANDARDS.md`). CI actions bumped:
  `actions/setup-node` and `actions/setup-python` to v7 (supersedes the
  Dependabot PR #48).
- **`setup` wizard knows runners × backends.** Q1 is now *runner* +
  *backend* with a resolution table (`api-base`, secret name, suggested
  `model` per pair, incl. Azure Foundry, xAI, Z.ai, self-hosted
  gateways), recommendation shortcuts, agent-runner hardening lines
  (`persist-credentials: false`, non-fork `if:`) emitted for every CLI
  runner including `grok`, and per-backend console URLs for the key.
- **`open-pr` sub-skill syncs the branch with the remote base before
  opening or refreshing a PR.** New automatic Step 1.5: fetch, merge
  `origin/<base>` into the current branch when behind, resolve conflicts
  keeping both sides' intent, run the repo's quick validation, commit,
  and push the current branch (non-force, announced in one line, no
  extra prompt). Honest trust boundary rewritten accordingly; explicit
  stop conditions (dirty tree, unjustifiable/binary conflict, failing
  gate, rejected push, linear-history repos ask once before rebase +
  `--force-with-lease`). Preview shows the sync outcome; the PR body
  gains a `## Merge notes` section when conflicts were resolved.
- **Dogfood matrix covers the new runners and backends.** `self-review.yml`
  adds legs for `grok` (`XAI_API_KEY`), `claude-code` on Z.ai GLM
  (`ZAI_CODING_API_KEY` + `api-base`), `codex` on Azure Foundry
  (`AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` + `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` /
  `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DAILY` repo variables) and an opt-in in-process
  `openai` leg (`SELF_REVIEW_OPENAI_CHAT=true`); smoke legs use the
  `economy` tier alias; `api-base` flows per leg. The four original legs
  are unchanged and legs without secrets stay absent from the matrix.
- **Test suite grew to 703 tests across 16 files** with three
  cross-cutting nets for the multi-backend work: a runner × backend
  matrix, a default-profile back-compat snapshot table captured from
  `main` (intentional deltas listed explicitly), and hardening
  regressions. `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` and `tests/README.md` now describe
  the real suite.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **Author-association gate is permission-aware on private org repos.** When the webhook `pull_request.author_association` under-reports membership (e.g. `CONTRIBUTOR` for an org admin with team-granted access), the runtime checks collaborator permission on **private / internal** repos only and allows `admin`, `maintain`, or `write` before skipping. Public repos stay association-only so narrowed presets like `OWNER,MEMBER` remain strict. Permission lookup failures fail-open on private/internal repos and fail-closed on public repos. Actionable logs include webhook association, resolved permission, visibility, allow-list, and decision. Private-repo consumers no longer need `author-association: ''` solely to work around the webhook quirk (Option B — permission-aware gate; see `docs/SECURITY.md`).

- **Complexity labels now work on all providers.** When `complexity-labels-enabled` is `true`, agent-runner providers (`cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`) include a required `complexity` field in `.aiprr/findings.json`; chat-completions uses `set_pr_complexity`. If the model omits the level, a diff-based heuristic fallback still applies the label so the feature is provider-agnostic end-to-end. `pr-description-mode: autocomplete` on agent-runners remains chat-completions-only.

### Changed
- **Harness: Deep Work Plan skill bumped to v2.17.0 + AI Diff Reviewer
  addon wired (Flow B).** Vendored `deepworkplan` via
  `npx skills update deepworkplan` (lockfile hash refresh). New addon
  lands at `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/addons/ai-diff-reviewer/`.
  Documented Flow B in `AGENTS.md` / `docs/AI_AGENT_COLLAB.md` /
  `.agents/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`: Security Review gains a
  local review pass (skill + `.review/extension.md`); CI dual-surface
  stays `.github/workflows/self-review.yml` (no consumer
  `pr-review.yml`). Dailybot addon already present — reconciled, no
  wiring changes. Consumer Action runtime unchanged.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-16

> **Shipping as v2.0.0.** Merge of this line cuts a SemVer major via
> `auto-release.yml` (`feat!:` commit). **`@v2` is the default consumer
> pin** going forward (skill `version: "2.0.0"`).

### v2 pin surface

Full guide: [`docs/MIGRATION_v2.md`](docs/MIGRATION_v2.md).

- **Default pin:** `uses: DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v2` and
  `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v2 --skill ai-diff-reviewer`.
- **`action.yml` contract:** no inputs renamed or removed.
- **Platform behaviour:** Iteration-Aware Review on every CI review;
  local skill reviews stay a full pass. Escape / reset /
  emergency-bypass: [`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md`](docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md),
  [`docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md`](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).

### Changed
- **Docs + skill + examples sync for IAR / `skip-review-label`, plus
  v2 pin surface.** Discoverability pass so Marketplace consumers and
  the companion skill see the same story as `action.yml`, and consumer
  copy-paste pins move to `@v2`:
  - `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md` — CI-only surfaces section
    (IAR + emergency bypass; local review stays a full pass); softened
    local↔CI parity claims (same methodology/severity; CI may dedupe
    on round 2+); skill `version: "2.0.0"`.
  - `setup/SKILL.md` Step 4 — "Next steps:" lead-in + defaults note;
    `setup/reference.md` — `skipped` output + related-docs links;
    `apply-review/SKILL.md` — ignore embedded IterationState when
    collecting findings.
  - `README.md` / `examples/**` / docs tree (`ARCHITECTURE`,
    `PRODUCT_SPEC`, `PROMPTS`, `PROVIDERS`, `SECURITY`, `STANDARDS`,
    root `SECURITY.md`, `prompts/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, …) —
    `@v2` moving major; Features emergency-bypass bullet;
    `ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` in the docs index; corrected local-skill
    wording (no local IAR dedup).
  - `examples/full-featured.yml` + `examples/README.md` — explicit
    IAR knobs + commented skip-review-label.
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` topology + `main()` Components prose
    (skip + IAR pre/post); `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` emergency-bypass;
    `docs/README.md` purpose one-liners.

### Added
- **Iteration-Aware Review (IAR) — convergence subsystem.** Every
  review now runs the IAR pipeline: dedupes findings against prior
  reports using content-anchored fingerprints (hash of the finding +
  ~20 lines of surrounding code), tracks generations (new commits or
  rebase reset the round counter), and applies one of four convergence
  policies (`iterative`, `first-pass-exhaustive` **— shipped default**,
  `round-capped`, `critical-gate`). **Critical severity findings ALWAYS
  surface unconditionally** — hardcoded safety rail, non-configurable.
  Human escape hatch via a `full-review-please` label that forces a
  full review without mutating persisted state. Full spec in
  [docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md](docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md).

### Public surface
- 4 new tunable inputs (all optional): `convergence-policy`
  (`first-pass-exhaustive`), `max-review-rounds` (`0`),
  `exhaustive-first-pass-cap-multiplier` (`3`),
  `iteration-escape-label` (`full-review-please`).
- 5 new outputs, populated on every successful IAR pipeline run and
  written as empty strings by the safety-net writer if the pipeline
  crashes — downstream steps always see a defined value:
  `iteration-round`, `iteration-generation`, `iteration-policy-applied`,
  `iteration-tokens-used`, `iteration-cost-vs-baseline-estimate`.

### Convergence policies
- **`first-pass-exhaustive`** (shipped default): round 1 of each
  generation runs with an expanded `max-inline-comments` cap (via
  `exhaustive-first-pass-cap-multiplier`, default `3×`) and a ~150-token
  prompt addendum telling the model to prefer completeness over
  conciseness. Round 2+ of the same generation delegate to `iterative`
  (dedup only). Directly solves the "same warnings on every re-run"
  symptom by front-loading the exhaustive pass.
- **`iterative`** (cost-neutral alternative): dedup only, no cap boost.
  Steady-state LLM cost is the no-dedup baseline; the reviewer just
  posts *deltas*. Recommended for push-heavy workflows where round 1
  of each new generation would fire frequently.
- **`round-capped`** (`max-review-rounds: N`): behaves like `iterative`
  for the first N rounds of a generation; from round N+1 onward,
  non-critical findings are silenced. Criticals still surface (safety
  rail). Warning: composing this with `strictness: block-on-warning`
  can silence a warning that would otherwise block — documented in
  [docs/STRICTNESS.md § Strictness × Iteration-Aware Review](docs/STRICTNESS.md).
- **`critical-gate`** (strict cross-generation dedup): silences
  fingerprints in `resolved_fingerprints` across generations, so a
  non-critical finding the developer previously fixed does not
  resurface even after new commits. Criticals still surface.

### Safety net + escape hatches
- **30% new-lines safety net**: when a `NEW_COMMITS` or `REBASED`
  transition adds ≥ 30% new lines to the current diff, the dispatcher
  forces `first-pass-exhaustive` for that run regardless of configured
  policy. Prevents accidental silencing on large pushes.
- **Escape label** (default `full-review-please`): a human applying
  this label to a PR bypasses dedup for the next run only. Persisted
  state is preserved so the following normal run resumes the dedup
  timeline from before the escape.
- **User-forced reset via reviewed-label removal**: on a PR that already
  has an IAR state block and a reviewed label (whatever the consumer
  set as `applied-label`, e.g. `ai-reviewed`), removing the reviewed
  label before the next review triggers a full IAR reset. The next
  run is classified as `USER_FORCED_RESET` — prior state is discarded,
  the generation counter restarts at 1, `resolved_fingerprints` and
  `open_fingerprints_this_gen` reset to empty, and round-1 exhaustive
  fires on a clean slate under the default policy. Reuses the labels
  the workflow already has — no new inputs, no new outputs. Distinct
  from the escape label (which is one-shot with state preserved):
  removing the reviewed label is the "start clean" gesture, applying
  the escape label is the "see everything this once" gesture. Full
  spec in [docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5](docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md).

### Observability + cost telemetry
- IAR emits five populated action outputs (`iteration-round`,
  `iteration-generation`, `iteration-policy-applied`,
  `iteration-tokens-used`, `iteration-cost-vs-baseline-estimate`) on
  every successful run. Written as empty strings by
  `write_iar_outputs_empty()` on every exit path first, then overwritten
  on the successful path via last-write-wins on `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`.
- The tracking-marker comment gains a one-line human-readable
  annotation (gen, round, policy, transition, surfaced/silenced
  counts) plus an embedded JSON state block the next run parses.
- Cost model documented in [docs/PERFORMANCE.md § Iteration-Aware
  Review](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) with a lifetime cost matrix per policy,
  per-round wall-clock breakdown, and three recommended
  cost/quality/balanced tuning profiles.

### Failure semantics
- IAR wraps its pre-LLM and post-LLM steps in `try/except` at the
  `main()` call site. On any IAR failure the reviewer logs the
  exception and falls back to the baseline review path — the CI
  check still gets a review, IAR just skips that specific run.
  Consumers never experience an IAR bug as "no review at all".

### Emergency-bypass label (`skip-review-label`)
- **New optional input `skip-review-label`.** Opt-in emergency-bypass
  hatch for hotfixes, rollbacks, and trivially-safe changes where an
  LLM review would burn tokens for no incremental value. When BOTH the
  workflow trigger fires AND the configured label is on the PR, the
  reviewer short-circuits BEFORE the LLM call: no findings, no state
  mutation, GitHub check reports success (exit 0) so the merge can
  proceed. A `⏭️ skipped` tracking comment records the skip and names
  the label so the audit trail stays intact.
- **Zero side effects on skip.** The `applied-label` is NOT stamped
  (applying it would misrepresent an unreviewed PR as reviewed); IAR
  state is NOT mutated (the next non-skip run resumes exactly where
  the pipeline left off); `collapse-previous` is NOT run (prior
  reviews stay visible so the human still has context before merging).
- **Empty default = feature disabled.** Consumers must consciously
  configure a label name to activate the bypass — no accidental
  bypass paths.
- **Security.** Anyone who can label a PR can bypass code review via
  this gesture. Consumers who care must combine the input with a
  ruleset / CODEOWNERS rule restricting who can apply the label —
  the runtime does not police that. Full contract + security notes
  in [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md § Emergency-bypass label](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).

### Documentation + examples
- New authoritative spec at [docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md](docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md).
- New example workflow at [examples/iteration-aware.yml](examples/iteration-aware.yml).
- IAR sections added to [docs/STRICTNESS.md](docs/STRICTNESS.md),
  [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md),
  [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md),
  [docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md](docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md),
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- README gains a feature callout in "What you get out of the box" and
  the inputs/outputs tables list all 4 new inputs + 5 new outputs.

### Safety contract
- New test suite `tests/test_iar_failure_fallback.py` locks the
  try/except safety invariant: garbled env vars still produce a valid
  `IARConfig`, `write_iar_outputs_empty()` always writes exactly 5
  empty outputs, and `write_all_outputs()` on every exit path
  (skip, success, block) always includes the 5 IAR outputs. CI fails
  any PR where this suite regresses.
- 200+ additional unit tests across
  `test_iar_state_layer.py`, `test_iar_generation_tracking.py`,
  `test_iar_dedup.py`, `test_iar_policies.py`, `test_iar_dispatch.py`,
  and `test_iar_observability.py` cover the pure IAR helpers. Total
  suite currently: **480 tests** (all passing). Updated across
  round-11..round-13 self-review fixes; the running counter is
  intentional — a slowly climbing total signals that every new
  behaviour lands with regression coverage.

### Fixed
- **IAR × `collapse-previous` ordering bug.** Before this fix, on the
  shipped default (`collapse-previous: true`), the tracking marker
  from the previous run was minimized BEFORE `run_iar_pre_llm()` read
  the embedded state block — and the marker fetcher explicitly skipped
  minimized comments, so IAR always saw `transition=first_review` and
  never dedup'd. Every consumer on defaults burned through round-1
  exhaustive on every run and never converged. Fix: teach
  `_fetch_latest_marker_body` to fall back to the latest **minimized**
  marker that carries an IAR state block when no visible marker does
  (three-tier priority: visible-with-state → minimized-with-state →
  any-marker). IAR state now persists across the collapse boundary;
  dedup + generation tracking engage on every default run. New tests
  in `test_iar_state_layer.py::FetchLatestMarkerTests` lock the
  three-tier ordering.
- **USER_FORCED_RESET false-positive after blocked runs.** Before this
  fix, USER_FORCED_RESET fired whenever the reviewed label was absent
  and prior state existed — but blocked runs (`block-on-critical` +
  critical finding) never stamp the reviewed label in the first place,
  so the natural re-trigger after a blocked run looked identical to a
  deliberate reset gesture and wiped fingerprint memory. Fix: persist
  a new `reviewed_label_applied: bool` bit inside `IterationState`
  (set to `True` only when the reviewer successfully stamps the label
  at the end of a non-blocked run), and gate USER_FORCED_RESET on that
  bit being `True` in the prior state. Reset now fires only when the
  reviewer previously stamped the label AND that label has since been
  removed — a genuinely deliberate developer gesture. Field is
  optional in the state schema (defaults to `False`) so state written
  before this fix parses cleanly and safely suppresses the gesture
  until the reviewer completes one successful run. New tests in
  `test_iar_observability.py::RunIarPreLlmTests` and
  `test_iar_state_layer.py::IterationStateRoundTripTests` lock the
  parse + gate contract.
- **USER_FORCED_RESET × escape-label precedence.** Before this fix,
  the `iteration-escape-label` short-circuit in `dispatch_policy` ran
  before the USER_FORCED_RESET check, so if a user applied BOTH
  gestures (removed the reviewed label AND added `full-review-please`)
  the escape label won — but escape preserves prior state whereas
  reset discards it, contradicting the "reset is the stronger
  gesture" contract documented in `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5`.
  Fix: reorder `dispatch_policy` to skip the escape-label
  short-circuit when `transition == USER_FORCED_RESET`, deferring to
  the configured policy's exhaustive first-pass path with prior state
  already cleared. New test in
  `test_iar_dispatch.py::DispatchPolicyPrecedenceTests` locks the
  precedence contract.
- **Round-1 exhaustive truncate could drop critical findings past the
  cap.** In `apply_first_pass_exhaustive_policy` and the agent-runner
  cap-enforce path, a naive `findings[:effective_cap]` was applied
  when the model overshot the cap. If the LLM emitted a critical
  finding at position 31 (or beyond) with `effective_cap=30`, the tail
  truncation silently dropped it — bypassing the hardcoded
  critical-always-surfaces safety rail
  (docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.1). Fix: introduce
  `_sort_findings_criticals_first` and call it BEFORE every truncation
  site, so criticals move to the front regardless of the model's
  emission order and the tail only sheds warnings/infos. New test
  `test_iar_policies.py::test_round_1_truncation_preserves_criticals_over_the_cap`
  locks the invariant.
- **`reviewed_label_applied=True` recorded before `gh_apply_label`
  succeeded.** Previously the IAR marker embed set
  `reviewed_label_applied` from `bool(applied_label and not blocked)`
  BEFORE attempting the label stamp. If the stamp then failed
  (network hiccup, revoked permissions, deleted-label race), the
  marker asserted the label was applied when in reality it was not
  — the next run then saw "reviewed label absent + state claims it
  was applied" and wrongly fired USER_FORCED_RESET, wiping dedup
  memory. Fix: attempt the label stamp FIRST inside a try/except,
  capture the OBSERVED outcome in a local `label_stamped: bool`,
  and only THEN embed that value into the state block. A stamp
  failure logs a non-fatal warning and records `False`, keeping the
  reset gesture honest across transient GH API failures.
- **Stale `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 13` references in
  `scripts/reviewer.py`.** The schema section was renumbered to § 12
  when the "Migration guide" was removed, but four inline comments
  still pointed at § 13. Updated in-place — no behavior change.
- **`compute_generation_range_hash` used two-dot diff instead of
  three-dot.** `git diff base_sha..head_sha` compares the two SHAs
  directly, so any upstream advance of `origin/<base>` (a normal
  base-branch merge that doesn't touch the PR) would change the hash
  and trigger a false `NEW_COMMITS` / `REBASED` transition — burning
  a full exhaustive pass and re-surfacing already-open warnings on
  any label-gated re-review after the base branch moved. Fixed by
  switching to `base_sha...head_sha` (three-dot), which pins the
  comparison to the merge base — matching `fetch_pr_context`'s
  `origin/<base>...HEAD` payload contract. Same three-dot fix applied
  to `compute_new_lines_pct`'s `total` diff so the safety-net
  denominator stays proportional to what the LLM actually reviewed.
  Docs § 4.3 code sample updated in lockstep.
- **`reviewed_label_applied` overwritten to `False` on blocked
  follow-up runs, silently disarming USER_FORCED_RESET.** The prior
  logic (`= label_stamped`) rewrote the bit from the current run's
  stamp outcome alone. A blocked run (`block-on-critical` fired) does
  not remove the label from the PR but wrote `reviewed_label_applied=False`
  anyway; when the developer then removed the label expecting a
  reset, the four-way guard failed on condition (c) and the reset
  silently no-op'd. Fixed by writing the bit as a three-signal OR:
  `label_stamped OR label_currently_on_pr OR prior_bit`. The bit
  is now `True` whenever the label is (or would be) present on the
  PR at the end of this run; blocked runs preserve the prior arming
  signal instead of clearing it. Docs § 8.5 and § 4.2 rewritten to
  match the new semantics.
- **Docs § 4.2 omitted the fourth USER_FORCED_RESET condition.** The
  paragraph listed three conditions and stopped, contradicting the
  authoritative § 8.5 spec and the runtime guard. Now enumerates all
  four (label configured, label absent, prior state exists, prior
  `reviewed_label_applied=True`) with an explicit note on why the
  fourth is load-bearing (blocked-run false-positive prevention).

### Known limitations (documented, not yet fixed)

- **Agent-runner overflow findings are not fingerprinted** (§ 13.1).
  Only surfaces when a CLI provider (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex)
  emits more findings than `effective-max-inline-comments` — the
  overflow is dropped after the criticals-first sort but before
  `run_iar_post_llm`, so it can re-surface in the next round.
  Tail-risk edge case; does not affect the chat-completions Provider
  path (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini) which fingerprints the full
  result set before the pipeline caps it.
- **`finding.body[:200]` fingerprint slice is a magic constant**
  (§ 13.2). Value is stable and documented; a follow-up will promote
  it to `IAR_FINGERPRINT_BODY_CHARS` next to the other IAR module
  constants. Cosmetic; no behavioral impact.

### Fixed (round-19 self-review: renumber drift + docstring polish)

Round-19 self-review **passed**. 1 warning + 4 infos:

- **`README.md`** local-skill divergence sentence still pointed at
  "step 7" after the round-18 IAR renumber (Submit is step 9).
- **`SilencedFinding` docstring** still said "Task 8 will surface…"
  — observability already ships; present-tense rewrite.
- **`apply_round_capped_policy` docstring** claimed post-cap routes
  through the dedup engine; the implementation filters criticals
  directly. Docstring now matches the code.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` TOC** was missing § 13 Known
  limitations (cross-linked from README / action.yml).
- Dropped the internal `PLAN_iteration_aware_review` Task 10
  reference from § 9.2 in favour of a PERFORMANCE.md pointer.

### Fixed (round-18 self-review: walkthrough foot-gun + README IAR pipeline)

Round-18 self-review **passed** (PR green after Cursor API recovered).
2 warnings + 3 infos — all doc/test polish:

- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 10.1`** still paired
  `max-review-rounds: 5` with `first-pass-exhaustive` — the same
  copy-paste foot-gun round-17 fixed in `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.
  Updated to the default `0` (unlimited) plus an explicit "do not
  copy `5`" callout.
- **`README.md § How it works`** marketplace pipeline walkthrough
  still omitted always-on IAR. Inserted steps 6 (pre-LLM) and 8
  (post-LLM) between fetch and submit; renumbered the rest.
- **Schema / § 9.6 examples** still showed `tokens_used: 24580`
  after the truth-in-labelling sweep. Both now show `0` with a
  note pointing at § 13.2.
- **`tests/test_iar_observability.py`** assertion message still
  said "four-condition guard"; updated to five-condition + the
  three-signal OR arming path.
- File-size overflow (~6830 LOC) already catalogued in § 13.4 —
  no change (info only).

### Fixed (round-17 self-review: PERFORMANCE.md tokens_used + max-review-rounds foot-gun)

Round-17 self-review **passed** (PR green, label stamped). 3 warnings
(F3 declined on user-directive grounds; see below) + 1 info (documented
known-limitation):

- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md § "Outputs — cost + latency telemetry"`** —
  `iteration-tokens-used` description tightened to match the
  authoritative contract in `action.yml` / `README.md` / skill
  reference. Previously said "Best-effort token count — populated by
  a future provider-hook PR"; now says "Cost-telemetry placeholder.
  Always emits `"0"` today [...] MUST NOT be gated on numeric
  thresholds until the follow-up lands." Aligns the last surface
  that was still describing this as aspirational rather than
  stable-placeholder.
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md § "Balanced (recommended default)" profile**
  — was suggesting `max-review-rounds: 5` (non-default) with the
  same "ignored by first-pass-exhaustive" comment that round-12
  fixed in `examples/iteration-aware.yml`. The foot-gun is that
  `max-review-rounds` is honoured under `round-capped`, so anyone
  who copy-pastes the profile and later switches policy silently
  gets a 5-round cap. Fixed to use the default `0` (unlimited)
  plus an explicit "do NOT copy `max-review-rounds: 5`" callout
  explaining the foot-gun.
- **F3 declined (CHANGELOG `### Removed` migration callout).** The
  reviewer suggested adding a `### Removed` entry for the
  `iteration-awareness-enabled` input, framed as a migration
  callout for consumers who opted out on the previous unpublished
  intermediate state. The user directive was to treat this as the
  first public version — no version-transition narrative, no
  migration hints from an unreleased state. IAR ships as
  always-on infrastructure and no consumer has ever seen an
  opt-out input on a published tag, so there is no cohort to
  guide.
- F4 (agent-runner cap overflow fingerprinting) is a pre-existing
  documented known limitation (§ 13.1); pattern-noted, no change.

### Fixed (round-16 self-review: full ITERATION_AWARENESS.md sweep + defensive guard)

Round-16 self-review **passed** (PR green, label stamped). 4 warnings
+ 2 infos, all doc drift the round-15 tokens_used pass missed +
one defensive guard suggestion:

- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` — comprehensive `iteration-tokens-
  used` sweep.** Round-15 aligned `action.yml`, `README.md`, and
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md`, but left four stale
  claims in the authoritative spec: § 3.2 (output table:
  "Sum of input+output"), § 9.1 (design principle: "populated
  from response metadata"), § 9.5 (definition: "= input_tokens +
  output_tokens"), and § 9.5 debug-log example (showed
  input_tokens=8432 / output_tokens=2103 that never emit). All
  four rewritten to describe the stable-placeholder-emits-"0"
  reality with a § 13.2 pointer for the follow-up.
- **`.review/extension.md` — USER_FORCED_RESET guard alignment.**
  The invariant block still described the guard as "All FOUR
  conditions"; round-14 added `label_fetch_ok` as the fifth.
  Rewritten to list all five conditions and name BOTH load-
  bearing safety guards (reviewed_label_applied + label_fetch_ok)
  by purpose so the reviewer's severity rules stay accurate.
- **`scripts/reviewer.py` — defensive `if skip_review_label:`
  guard.** `_labels_contain_ci` already returns False for an
  empty needle (documented contract), so the previous code was
  behaviourally correct. Added the explicit guard anyway with a
  detailed inline comment explaining why: the "feature disabled
  when input is empty" contract is now visible at the call site,
  and a hypothetical future change to `_labels_contain_ci` that
  optimizes empty-needle behaviour differently (e.g. a
  `return True` for length-normalisation reasons) cannot
  silently activate the skip-review short-circuit for consumers
  who don't use the feature.

### Fixed (round-15 self-review: label_fetch_ok doc drift + tokens_used truth in labeling)

Round-15 self-review **passed** (PR green, label stamped). 3 warnings,
all pure doc drift — no runtime changes:

- **`iteration-tokens-used` documentation aligned with reality.**
  `action.yml`, `README.md`, and
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md` all claimed the
  output was "Total input + output tokens consumed by the LLM in
  this run", but `RunTelemetry.tokens_used` is never populated from
  provider usage metadata — successful IAR runs always emit `"0"`.
  Consumers building cost dashboards on the output were being lied
  to. Updated all three surfaces to describe it as a stable
  placeholder that emits `"0"` today and cross-reference
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 13.2` for the follow-up plan.
- **`.github/workflows/self-review.yml`** smoke-test comment for
  the USER_FORCED_RESET verification procedure still described a
  "four-condition" guard and (a)–(d). Round-14 added the fifth
  guard (`label_fetch_ok`); comment now lists all five with
  their round-14 semantics, plus a new NO-OP case for the
  transient-fetch-failure deferral.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` § 4.2** trailing paragraph
  attributed blocked-run prevention to "the fourth condition" —
  correct in the pre-round-14 numbering (when
  `reviewed_label_applied` was condition 4), but stale after
  round-14 inserted `label_fetch_ok` as condition 4 and pushed
  `reviewed_label_applied` back to condition 3. Reworded to name
  BOTH load-bearing safety guards by condition number and
  purpose, so a future reader can't miss either.
- `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 13.2` (per-generation telemetry
  known-limitation) expanded to describe the coordinated two-piece
  follow-up: capture per-provider usage metadata AT the LLM-response
  boundary (currently missing) + accumulate telemetry across a
  generation's rounds (currently mis-attributes on `advance_
  generation`). Both matter most when cost dashboards get built
  on the outputs.

### Fixed (round-14 self-review: label-fetch failure guard for USER_FORCED_RESET)

Round-14 self-review **passed** (PR green, label stamped). One warning
was a real security bug worth calling out on its own:

- **`_fetch_pr_labels` now returns `(labels, ok)`.** Previous shape
  `list[str]` collapsed two distinct outcomes into the same value:
  "the API said the PR has no labels" and "the API failed, we don't
  know". The escape-label check on the `SAME_GENERATION` path
  could safely coalesce them ("no escape label" is a REVERSIBLE
  "don't take the escape hatch on THIS run only" decision). But
  the USER_FORCED_RESET branch is IRREVERSIBLE — it wipes
  fingerprint memory + resets the generation counter — and the
  same `[]` was silently being read as "reviewed label absent"
  every time a GitHub 5xx returned an empty list from the labels
  fetch. Under the shipped default `block-on-critical` strictness,
  a transient outage would silently wipe a converged PR's dedup
  state on the next run — the exact "infinite loop" symptom IAR
  is designed to prevent, but triggered by API instability
  instead of convergence pressure.
- **`run_iar_pre_llm` USER_FORCED_RESET check gated on
  `label_fetch_ok`** — the fifth condition alongside the round-7
  `reviewed_label_applied` guard. Both distinguish "we know the
  developer removed the label" from a superficially-identical
  false-positive; both are non-blocking (a transient failure
  simply delays the reset gesture until the next successful fetch).
- Docstrings for `GenerationTransition.USER_FORCED_RESET`,
  `run_iar_pre_llm`, and `_fetch_pr_labels` all rewritten to
  describe the "know vs don't-know" distinction and why the ok
  bit is load-bearing.
- `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md` § 4.2, § 8.5, and § 15 (changelog)
  updated to describe the five-condition guard (was four in
  round-7) and cross-reference the `label_fetch_ok` bit.
- 3 new regression tests: `FetchPrLabelsTests.
  test_pr_with_no_labels_returns_empty_and_ok` (locks the
  operational-empty case), `test_api_failure_returns_empty_and_not_ok`
  (locks the failure case). `RunIarPreLlmTests.
  test_user_forced_reset_no_op_when_label_fetch_failed` (locks
  the new guard) and `test_user_forced_reset_fires_only_when_
  fetch_ok_and_label_absent` (contrast test proving `ok` is the
  ONLY difference between the two branches). All 8 pre-existing
  `_fetch_pr_labels` patch sites updated from `return_value=[...]`
  to `return_value=([...], True)`.
- CHANGELOG stale test count `468` bumped to `480` (round-14 adds
  3 tests; the running counter continues to climb).

### Fixed (round-13 self-review: skip-label collision guard + test coverage)

Round-13 self-review **passed** (PR green, label stamped). 3 warnings +
2 infos, all real but small — the load-bearing one is the new
skip-label collision guard:

- **`detect_skip_label_collisions()` — new misconfiguration guard.**
  `skip-review-label` is an emergency-bypass hatch (silently skips
  the review). If a user accidentally sets it to the same value as
  `label-gate`, `applied-label`, or `iteration-escape-label`, every
  normal trigger silently becomes a skip — the exact opposite of
  what the developer typed. The three failure modes were previously
  undocumented and undetected. New pure helper detects all three
  collisions, `main()` aborts at startup with an exit-1
  `CONFIGURATION ERROR:` log naming the colliding label. Comparison
  is case-insensitive (matches `_labels_contain_ci` at the check
  sites) and whitespace-trimmed. 9 new regression tests in
  `SkipLabelCollisionGuardTests`.
- **Hoisted `bot_login` lookup got a proper `# noqa: BLE001` WHY
  comment** — the round-11 hoist landed with the noqa but no
  explanation of the "best-effort GH API call" pattern documented
  in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` / `.review/extension.md`.
- **CHANGELOG test count updated** from stale `456` to current
  `477` (rising counter is now called out as intentional so
  future readers see it climb with each self-review round rather
  than assume it's drift).
- **`stable_sort_by_severity` comment drift** in
  `apply_first_pass_exhaustive_policy` — the helper was renamed
  to `_sort_findings_criticals_first` in round-3; the
  round-3-adjacent comment still referenced the old name.
- **`action.yml` + `README.md` + `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/
  reference.md`** updated to document the new misconfig-guard
  behaviour so consumers know why the reviewer would exit-1
  loudly on a colliding label config.

### Fixed (round-12 self-review: doc-drift sweep + magic-number promotion)

Round-12 self-review **passed the strictness gate** (highest severity =
warning, `self-reviewed:cursor` label stamped, PR green) and flagged
4 warnings + 1 info — all doc/polish, no runtime bugs:

- **Two more case-sensitive-label doc drift sites** (round-11 fixed
  the `IAR — User-controllable inputs` section but the follow-on
  reviewer caught two other spots): `docs/SECURITY.md § API surface
  delta` for skip-review-label still said `skip_review_label in
  current_labels`, and `compute_reviewed_label_applied`'s docstring
  (signal 2) said `applied_label in current_labels`. Both updated
  to `_labels_contain_ci` and cross-referenced with `label-gate`,
  escape-label, and skip-review-label as the four consumers of
  the same helper.
- **`examples/iteration-aware.yml` comment** claimed "every input
  below matches the shipped default" but `max-review-rounds: 5`
  is non-default (default is `0 = unlimited`). Copy-paste
  consumers who kept the value would silently be running under a
  `round-capped: 5` semantics if they later switched policies.
  Rewrote the comment to explicitly mark `max-review-rounds` as
  `NON-DEFAULT (demo)` and split the DEFAULT vs demo inputs.
- **`finding.body[:200]` magic number** in `finding_fingerprint`
  promoted to module-level `IAR_FINGERPRINT_BODY_PREFIX_CHARS: int
  = 200` next to `IAR_CONTEXT_HASH_RADIUS`. Removed the "known
  limitation" § 13.2 entry (no longer a limitation); § 13.3/13.4
  renumbered. Doc code-block in ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 5.2 also
  updated to reference the constant.
- **File-size overflow note.** `scripts/reviewer.py` grew past the
  ~4500-line soft ceiling in `docs/STANDARDS.md` due to the IAR
  landing. Added a new § 13.4 "Known limitation" documenting the
  overflow, the two considered refactor paths (submodule vs
  orchestrator-step split), and the deferral rationale — both
  paths trade the file-size ceiling against the load-bearing
  "single-file stdlib runtime" invariant, so the refactor
  deserves its own PR to be reviewed on its own.

### Fixed (round-11 self-review: bot_login hoist + doc alignment)

Round-11 self-review **passed the strictness gate** (highest severity =
warning, `self-reviewed:cursor` label stamped, PR green) but flagged 3
warnings around defensive edge cases and doc drift:

- **`bot_login` was scoped inside `if collapse_previous:`,** so
  consumers with `collapse-previous: false` (or any run where
  `gh_get_authenticated_login` raised) hit `UnboundLocalError` at
  the `run_iar_pre_llm(bot_login=bot_login, …)` call site — falling
  through the IAR try/except into baseline mode with the round-10
  author filter effectively disabled. Hoisted the resolution to
  ALWAYS run (with a `""` fallback that mirrors the pre-round-10
  behaviour on failure). Both consumers — `gh_collapse_previous_reviews`
  and the IAR author filter — now see the same resolved identity
  regardless of `collapse_previous` setting.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md § IAR — User-controllable inputs`** still
  described escape-label matching as `in pr_labels` (case-sensitive
  membership) after round-8's `_labels_contain_ci` fix. Updated to
  reflect the case-insensitive helper and explicitly call out the
  three consumers (escape label, skip-review-label, and
  reviewed-label reset) that share the normalisation.
- **`IterationState.reviewed_label_applied` field comment** described
  the pre-round-7 semantics ("True only when the review posted AND
  was NOT blocked"). Round-7 replaced that with the three-signal OR
  in `compute_reviewed_label_applied` — updated the comment to
  match, listing all three signals and the load-bearing rationale
  ("otherwise a blocked follow-up would silently clear the arming
  bit").

### Fixed (round-10 self-review: marker author filter + parser trust boundary)

- **Marker fetch now filters by comment author (SECURITY, critical).**
  `_fetch_latest_marker_body` accepts an optional `bot_login: str`
  and drops every marker whose `author.login` doesn't match — using
  the same `[bot]` / no-suffix normalisation
  `gh_collapse_previous_reviews` uses. Without this filter, any PR
  participant who could comment on the PR could forge a marker
  carrying fabricated `open_fingerprints_this_gen` values, and —
  under the shipped default `collapse-previous: true` — the real
  bot marker is minimized while the attacker's fresh forgery is
  visible, winning tier 1 and silencing genuine non-critical
  findings on the next run. (The critical-always-surfaces rail
  would still surface `critical` findings, but warnings and infos
  could be suppressed.) `main()` resolves `bot_login` via
  `gh_get_authenticated_login` (as it already does for
  `gh_collapse_previous_reviews`) and threads it through
  `run_iar_pre_llm` → `read_prior_iteration_state` →
  `_fetch_latest_marker_body`. Regression tests:
  `test_author_filter_rejects_non_bot_forged_marker`,
  `test_author_filter_normalizes_bot_suffix`,
  `test_author_filter_disabled_when_no_bot_login`.
- **`reviewed_label_applied` now only accepts JSON `true`/`false`
  (or `0`/`1`).** Naive `bool()` on a JSON string is a foot-gun
  (`bool("false") is True`), so a poisoned marker with
  `"reviewed_label_applied": "false"` would spuriously arm
  `USER_FORCED_RESET`. Non-boolean values fall back to `False`
  (safe default — reset stays disarmed). Regression tests:
  `test_reviewed_label_applied_rejects_string_false`,
  `test_reviewed_label_applied_accepts_json_true`.
- **Fingerprint lists are now element-coerced at parse time.**
  Without this, a poisoned marker with
  `"resolved_fingerprints": [{"x": 1}]` would parse fine but crash
  `dedupe_findings_against_prior`'s `set(...)` with
  `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`. Since IAR runs on every
  round, this would trigger the `try/except` fallback on every
  subsequent run — a sticky DoS on convergence until the poisoned
  marker aged out of the fetch window. Non-string elements are
  now dropped silently at parse time (over-review is the safe
  direction). Same coercion applied to `history` (list of dicts
  only; scalars would blow up the `history[-1]` mutation in
  `run_iar_post_llm`). Regression tests:
  `test_fingerprint_list_drops_non_string_elements`,
  `test_history_drops_non_dict_elements`.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md § IAR — Marker-embedded state block`
  restructured** to describe both controls (source authenticity
  via author filter + field-level trust boundary in parser) with
  concrete failure modes for each. Round-10 F4 caught the drift
  before the code fix landed — updated in the same commit.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 12` schema example** now
  includes `head_sha` and `reviewed_label_applied` fields so
  the copyable JSON matches what the runtime actually embeds
  via `asdict(IterationState)`.

### Fixed (round-9 self-review: multi-provider IAR state isolation + enum docstring)

- **`_fetch_latest_marker_body` / `read_prior_iteration_state` now
  optionally filter marker chains by `provider_id`.** Multi-provider
  setups — e.g. this repo's own self-review matrix if it grew a second
  provider — were reading each other's IAR state, cross-poisoning
  fingerprint memory, generation hashes, and round counters
  (round-9 F1 critical). The filter matches markers carrying the
  exact `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-provider: <id> -->` tag; untagged legacy
  markers (posted before the provider marker was introduced) match
  every provider, preserving back-compat for upgrades. `main()` now
  passes the current run's `provider_id` through the IAR pre-LLM
  pipeline. Three new regression tests in
  `tests/test_iar_state_layer.py` cover the three cases: isolated
  reads, legacy-untagged back-compat, and empty-`provider_id`
  filter-disabled semantics.
- **`GenerationTransition.USER_FORCED_RESET` enum docstring** now
  lists all four gating conditions (including the load-bearing
  `reviewed_label_applied` guard) so the enum-level documentation
  matches the runtime + `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5`.
  Round-9 F2 caught the drift; contract itself was already correct.

### Fixed (round-8 self-review: pagination revert + escape-label output + label case-insensitivity)

Round-8 found the **regression I introduced in round-7 (F1 critical)**
plus two more polish items and completed the round-7 escape-label
observability fix I only did halfway:

- **`_fetch_latest_marker_body` GraphQL `last: 250` was invalid — the
  hard cap on `pullRequest.comments` is 100.** Reverted to
  `last: 100`; server was raising `EXCESSIVE_PAGINATION` on every
  call, so IAR classified every run as `first_review` and burned
  round-1 exhaustive forever, which is exactly the symptom the
  round-7 patch was supposed to prevent. Updated
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.3` to honestly document the
  100-comment ceiling (still safe failure mode; the cursor-pagination
  follow-up is unchanged).
- **`iteration-policy-applied` action output was reading
  `state.policy_applied` instead of `policy_result.policy_applied`
  — the exact bug pattern round-7 fixed for the marker footer,
  but only fixed one of the two consumers.** On an escape-label run
  the output would report the preserved-state's prior policy
  (e.g. `first-pass-exhaustive`) instead of the current run's
  effective policy (`escape-label-forced-full-review`), silently
  defeating workflow greps / dashboards keying on the output. Fixed
  by rendering `policy_result.policy_applied`; new regression test
  `test_iteration_policy_applied_reads_from_policy_result_not_state`.
- **Case-sensitive label matching was inconsistent with `label-gate`
  (which is case-insensitive).** `check_escape_label`, the skip-review
  short-circuit, and USER_FORCED_RESET detection were all using exact
  `in` membership, so a casing mismatch could either silently fail to
  fire (escape / skip) or — worst case — falsely register "reviewed
  label removed" and wipe fingerprint memory (USER_FORCED_RESET).
  Fixed by introducing `_labels_contain_ci` (whitespace-trimmed,
  case-insensitive membership) and routing all three sensitive
  comparisons through it. `compute_reviewed_label_applied` also uses
  the helper for the "label currently on PR" signal.
- **`action.yml` / README / `setup/reference.md` /
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 3.2` `iteration-policy-applied`
  descriptions all claimed the safety-net override string was
  `first-pass-exhaustive`.** The runtime actually emits
  `safety-net-forced-first-pass-exhaustive` (via
  `IAR_POLICY_SAFETY_NET_FORCED`), so operators grepping for the
  short name miss every safety-net firing. Aligned all four surfaces
  with the shipping string and added a "grep this to audit" note.

### Fixed (round-7 self-review: escape-label footer bug + observability polish)

Round-7 caught a **real runtime bug** on the escape-label observability
path plus 3 doc-drift stragglers and 1 comment miscalibration:

- **Escape-label marker footer bug (runtime).**
  `_render_iar_marker_annotation` was rendering `state.policy_applied`,
  but on an escape-label run `run_iar_post_llm` returns the *prior*
  state unchanged (that is the contract — no mutation) while the
  current run's effective policy lives in `policy_result.policy_applied`
  (set to `escape-label-forced-full-review` by `dispatch_policy`).
  The footer therefore showed the PREVIOUS policy (e.g.
  `first-pass-exhaustive`), silently defeating the audit greps
  documented in `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5` (operators
  greping for `policy=\`escape-label-forced-` would find zero
  matches even when the escape label was used every single review).
  Fixed by rendering `policy_result.policy_applied` — this also
  keeps the safety-net override (`safety-net-forced-…`) visible
  because that override is also set on `policy_result`, not on the
  preserved-state. New regression test
  `test_renders_policy_result_not_state_policy` locks the invariant.
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` cost-telemetry table** — round-6 narrowed
  the `iteration-cost-vs-baseline-estimate` contract to `"0%"` /
  `"+N%"` across four surfaces but missed this one, which still
  listed `-5%` as an example. Fixed; added a "never gate CI on
  `== '-N%'`" warning matching the other four surfaces.
- **`_estimate_cost_vs_baseline` docstring** — still advertised
  `"-10%"` as a typical return value. Rewrote to match the shipping
  contract (`"0%"` / `"+N%"`), pointed at § 13.4 for the follow-up
  extension, and clarified that `silenced_count` / `surfaced_count`
  parameters are accepted-but-not-yet-consumed (stable signature for
  the future silence-savings model).
- **Marker-fetch pagination ceiling** — `_fetch_latest_marker_body`
  was requesting `comments(last: 100)`. On very long-lived PRs where
  100+ human/bot comments accumulate after the last state-bearing
  marker was minimized, that marker would fall out of the window and
  IAR would re-classify the run as `first_review` and re-burn round-1
  exhaustive. Raised the window to `last: 250` (the practical
  single-page ceiling for `pullRequest.comments` on the v4 GraphQL
  endpoint) and documented the ceiling + safe failure mode
  (over-review, never under-surface) + the follow-up cursor
  pagination path in `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.3`.
- **Comment miscalibration** — `IAR_EXHAUSTIVE_PROMPT_ADDENDUM`
  comment claimed `≈40 tokens`. The actual addendum is ~70 words
  (~90-150 tokens) and `docs/PROMPTS.md` / `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`
  already budget it at ~150. Aligned the comment.

### Fixed (round-6 self-review doc + telemetry-contract sweep)

Round-6 self-review flagged 3 doc warnings + 2 comment infos. Runtime
was again signed off as merge-ready (*"Runtime invariants look correct
and are locked by 456 passing tests. Remaining issues are operator-
facing doc/telemetry drift."*). All 5 items fixed:

- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 4.5`** — removed the residual
  `(safety_net_new_lines_pct)` reference in the transition-slot
  audit paragraph (missed by the round-5 sweep, which only fixed
  § 7.2 / § 10.2). The paragraph now correctly lists the five
  natural transition values and points policy-override audits at
  `policy=\`safety-net-forced-` / `policy=\`escape-label-forced-`.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5`** — the "how the two are
  distinguished" paragraph claimed escape shows as `(escape_label)`
  in the transition slot. It doesn't — `dispatch_policy` renames
  the `policy_applied` slot to `escape-label-forced-full-review`
  and leaves the natural transition untouched. Rewrote to describe
  the actual footer shape for both gestures and gave programmatic
  audit greps.
- **`scripts/reviewer.py:6051`** — replaced the stale "When IAR is
  enabled" comment with the correct "on round 1 of a new generation
  under `first-pass-exhaustive` (or when the safety net fires)"
  wording. IAR is unconditional now; the effective-cap raise fires
  under specific policy conditions, not an on/off switch.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 2`** — the safety-contract text
  claimed `main()` wraps IAR in `try/except BaseException`, but both
  call sites use `except Exception`. `Exception` is the correct
  choice (avoids swallowing `SystemExit` / `KeyboardInterrupt`);
  updated the spec to match the code and explained why.
- **Cost-vs-baseline heuristic contract narrowed to what
  `_estimate_cost_vs_baseline` actually returns.** The function
  today only combines cap expansion + a flat `+5%` addendum flag —
  it can emit `"0%"` or `"+N%"` but never `"-N%"` / `"unknown"`.
  The four documentation surfaces (`action.yml`, `README.md`,
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 3.2 / § 9.5`,
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md`) were advertising
  the fuller `-30%` / `"unknown"` values from the original spec.
  Rewrote each to describe only the shipping return values and
  added an explicit warning that consumers MUST NOT gate CI on
  `iteration-cost-vs-baseline-estimate == '-30%'` (the condition
  will never fire). New `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 13.4`
  catalogues this as a known limitation with the follow-up work
  needed to restore the fuller heuristic.

### Fixed (round-5 self-review doc-drift sweep)

Round-5 self-review found 5 doc/example drift items and 1 already-tracked
info. Runtime was independently signed off as merge-ready by the reviewer
(*"Runtime invariants look correct and are well locked by tests (456 passing).
A few documentation mismatches will mislead operators auditing markers or
copying the 'quality-sensitive' profile."*). All five drift items fixed:

- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.2` "delete the marker to reset"
  advice was false under shipped defaults.** With
  `collapse-previous: true` (the default), `_fetch_latest_marker_body`'s
  tier-2 fallback (§ 7.3) reads the latest **minimized** marker that
  still carries IAR state, so deleting the visible marker leaves prior
  state accessible and the next run continues the generation instead
  of becoming `first_review`. Rewrote the paragraph to point at the
  real reset gesture (§ 8.5 reviewed-label removal), and noted that a
  delete-based reset would require removing **every** marker in the
  conversation with `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-iteration-state`.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.2` safety-net marker example
  invented a `(safety_net_new_lines_pct)` transition token that the
  runtime never emits.** The runtime prefixes the `policy_applied`
  slot with `safety-net-forced-` and keeps the `transition` value at
  the natural `new_commits` / `rebased`. Rewrote the example to show
  the actual output (`policy=`safety-net-forced-first-pass-exhaustive`
  (new_commits)`) and added a "grep this to audit safety-net firings"
  callout. Same drift fixed in § 10.2's walkthrough table.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.1` + § 10.3 escape-label examples
  used the same aspirational H3 shape** (`### AI review for abc123 —
  done · escape-label forced full review (state preserved) · ...`)
  that the runtime never emits. Rewrote both to the shipping shape
  (short H3 + italic footer with `policy=`escape-label-forced-full-review`).
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` "quality-sensitive" recommended profile was
  factually wrong.** It combined `convergence-policy: round-capped`
  with `exhaustive-first-pass-cap-multiplier: 5`, but `round-capped`
  ignores the multiplier entirely (`action.yml`'s input description is
  explicit: "Ignored by other policies"). Consumers copying this
  block would have expected a 50-finding round-1 net and got baseline
  10-cap iterative behaviour. Fixed to `first-pass-exhaustive` (the
  only policy that amplifies round 1), and added a separate
  "round-cap discipline" profile for consumers who genuinely want a
  hard round cap without amplification. Explanatory blockquote now
  makes the policy-vs-multiplier composition rule explicit.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § Iteration-Aware Review` + new
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 3.4`** now document the load-bearing
  dependency on `tracking-comment: true`. If a consumer disables the
  tracking comment (`tracking-comment: false`), `gh_update_issue_comment`
  no-ops (`comment_id <= 0`) and IAR never persists a state block.
  Every subsequent run then classifies as `first_review` and re-burns
  round-1 exhaustive under the default policy — a silent convergence
  killer. Both docs now call this out explicitly.
- **`examples/README.md`** now lists the new `iteration-aware.yml`
  in the contents table (repo convention + AGENTS.md Rule #7:
  "Add a row to the table above in the same PR"). Description
  points readers at the IAR spec for context.

### Fixed (round-4 self-review sweep)

Final polish pass driven by the self-review of the doc-sweep commit
— five doc/comment stragglers + one real runtime attribution bug:

- **`run_iar_post_llm` was backfilling the closed prior generation's
  `history[-1]` entry with the CURRENT run's telemetry** on
  `NEW_COMMITS` / `REBASED` transitions. But the current run is round
  1 of the NEW generation, so its `tokens_used` + `wall_clock_ms`
  belong to the new gen — attributing them backward misreported
  per-generation cost history and (once token accounting lands)
  would poison the cost-vs-baseline estimate. Fixed by removing the
  backfill; the closed entry retains its `(0, 0)` placeholders.
  Proper per-generation accumulation is documented as follow-up in
  `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 13.3`. Regression locked by
  `test_iar_observability.py::test_new_commits_does_not_backfill_current_run_telemetry_into_prior_gen`.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 4.5` marker-title example was
  aspirational** — described an H3 like `Gen 2 round 1 (new commits
  since …)` that the runtime never emits. `render_tracking_body_done`
  ships a short `### AI review for <sha> — <status>` and IAR appends
  a quiet italic footer via `_render_iar_marker_annotation`
  (`gen 2, round 1, policy=... (transition)`). Rewrote the example
  to match the shipping output and updated the audit grep pattern
  from `Gen \d+ round \d+` → `gen \d+, round \d+`.
- **`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.2` safety-net formula was wrong.**
  Said `git diff --stat` + `(added + removed + context)` denominator;
  the runtime is `git diff --numstat` + `(added + removed)` on the
  three-dot range (numstat doesn't emit context lines). Rewrote the
  paragraph to match the code, including the two-vs-three-dot
  reasoning for the `new_added` numerator vs `total` denominator.
- **`compute_new_lines_pct` docstring said two-dot** for the `total`
  diff even though the implementation now correctly uses three-dot.
  Docstring updated to match, with an explicit two-dot-on-purpose
  note for the `new_added` numerator (both head SHAs → no merge-base
  semantics apply).
- **`.github/workflows/self-review.yml` comment claimed
  `max-review-rounds: 5` dogfooded the `round-capped` composition**
  path, but under `convergence-policy: first-pass-exhaustive` (this
  workflow's shipped-default policy), the runtime does not invoke
  `apply_round_capped_policy` at all — `max-review-rounds` is a
  no-op. Reset the input to the shipped default `0` and rewrote the
  surrounding comment to note that a future matrix leg pinned to
  `round-capped` would be where the value becomes meaningful.
- **`.github/workflows/self-review.yml` USER_FORCED_RESET smoke-test
  procedure omitted the four-condition guard.** Explicitly enumerated
  all four checks the runtime performs (`applied-label` configured,
  label absent, prior state exists, `prior_state.reviewed_label_applied
  == True`) and documented the NO-OP CASES (blocked prior run,
  first-ever review of the PR) so a developer running the smoke test
  on a blocked PR does not misdiagnose the silent no-op as a
  regression.

### Fixed (doc-sweep after three-dot landing)

Self-review of the three-dot generation-hash fix surfaced doc /
docstring stragglers that still described the old two-dot behaviour,
plus a copy-paste example missing `github-token`. All are content-only
changes; no runtime code touched:

- `examples/iteration-aware.yml` now passes `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
  and updates the `fetch-depth` comment to reference three-dot diffs.
- `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 12.1` schema cell for
  `generation_range_hash` now shows three-dot and links back to § 4.3.
  Same section's `reviewed_label_applied` cell rewritten to describe
  the three-signal OR write logic (was still describing the pre-fix
  intent-only bit).
- `docs/SECURITY.md` IAR subprocess-boundary section now enumerates
  three-dot for both `git diff` call sites (generation hash + safety
  net `--numstat`), matching the runtime.
- `scripts/reviewer.py` — `IterationState.generation_range_hash`
  docstring rewritten to say "three-dot" explicitly and reference
  § 4.3; stale "when IAR is off" wording in the chat-completions
  tools-schema comment reframed for the unconditional runtime.
- `tests/test_iar_state_layer.py` module docstring reframed for the
  unconditional runtime (was still describing IAR as opt-in via a
  "master switch").

- **New "Security audit alignment" section in `.review/extension.md`.**
  Codifies the review rules that keep the two external security
  surfaces at 100% pass — (1) [skills.sh badges](https://www.skills.sh/dailybothq/ai-diff-reviewer/ai-diff-reviewer)
  (Gen Agent Trust Hub, Socket, Snyk) for the vendored skill package,
  and (2) the [GitHub Marketplace listing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-diff-reviewer)
  posture for the CI Action. Existing rules covered runtime code
  security (subprocess, path safety, env-var allowlist, secret
  redaction, marker contracts); the new section extends coverage to
  the three surfaces the audits actually inspect: **skill files**
  (`curl … | sh` in examples, `allowed-tools:` without a Step 0 Trust
  boundary, prompt-injection language, leaked-looking token
  substrings), **workflows AND shipped `examples/*.yml`**
  (`pull_request_target` without an `if:` guard, missing job-level
  `permissions:` block, third-party actions pinned by tag instead of
  SHA, `actions/checkout` on untrusted code without
  `persist-credentials: false`, unmasked secret echo, `curl`/`wget`
  to untrusted domains), and **documentation sync** (`action.yml`
  input adding a new attack surface without a matching
  `docs/SECURITY.md` update; new workflow file added without a
  matching entry in `.github/dependabot.yml`). No runtime behaviour
  change — this file only affects what the LLM reviewer flags on this
  repo's own PRs.
- **New `apply-review` sub-skill in the `ai-diff-reviewer` skill
  family.** Closes the post-CI-run loop: reads the AI Diff Reviewer
  review the CI Action posted back on the current branch's open PR,
  presents the findings in the **same format as the parent skill's
  local review** (verdict → findings table → per-finding body →
  recommendation), and — with explicit per-finding consent — walks
  the developer through each finding to apply, defer, or skip.
  Multi-provider aware: when the repo runs a matrix of self-review
  legs (`self-reviewed:anthropic`, `-cursor`, `-codex`, `-claude-code`),
  the sub-skill attributes each finding to its leg and surfaces
  cross-leg consensus (*"agreed by 3/3 legs → strong signal"*).
  Anchors on the latest `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->` and filters
  `isMinimized: true` comments per the mandatory rules in
  [`docs/PR_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/PR_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md) — that
  doc is now executable via this sub-skill instead of only readable.
  Read-only by default; source-file edits happen only under the
  Step 6 per-finding consent contract (never `git add`, never commit,
  never push). Fifth capability added to the parent
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md` router; cross-referenced from
  the `open-pr` sub-skill's "Coordinating with other skills"
  section (natural successor after CI reviews the PR).

### Fixed
- **CI: `auto-release.yml` Step 3.5 now passes `-y` to `skills add`.**
  The vendored dogfood-refresh step ran the `skills` CLI without a
  non-interactive flag on the subcommand itself (`npx --yes` only
  covers npm's own "Ok to proceed?" prompt), so it hit the
  interactive *"Which agents do you want to install to?"* picker in
  a non-TTY environment, hung, and never actually refreshed
  `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`. The subsequent sanity check
  correctly refused to commit a stale snapshot, but the whole
  release job failed after the tag was already pushed — leaving
  v1.6.1 in a partially-published state (see v1.6.1 recovery entry
  below). Fix adds the missing `-y` and a comment explaining why
  both flags are required.

### Changed
- **Parent `ai-diff-reviewer` skill (`skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md`)
  clarifies the two supported flows.** Added a new "Two supported
  flows: local-only or dual-surface" section that names each flow
  explicitly (Flow A = local-only, no CI Action; Flow B = dual-surface,
  local + CI), spells out which sub-skills to run and which to skip for
  each, documents the parity guarantee that makes dual-surface
  worthwhile, and gives copy-paste signalling phrases so an agent
  doesn't have to guess. Motivation: the four sub-skills were already
  independent by design, but the parent SKILL.md read as a single
  lifecycle where every consumer runs all four — masking the fact that
  `setup` is entirely optional for repos that want local-only review.
- **Ambiguity tie-break no longer defaults to `setup`.** Previously,
  when a repo had no workflows and the developer had just installed the
  skill, the parent SKILL.md's disambiguation heuristic guessed
  "probably the setup flow." That biased agents toward writing
  `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` on repos where the developer only
  wanted a local reviewer. The heuristic now instructs the agent to
  ASK ("Flow A local-only vs Flow B dual-surface") before routing, so
  the CI Action is never installed unrequested.

### Fixed (self-review of the above)
- **Ask-heuristic now scopes on the ai-diff-reviewer workflow
  specifically, not "no workflows at all".** Original wording gated
  on "Repo has NO workflows" — but almost every real repo already
  has some `.github/workflows/` file (tests, deploys, Dependabot), so
  the heuristic silently didn't fire and the routing fix was
  bypassed. Now scoped to "no `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` (or
  similarly-named AI Diff Reviewer workflow) AND no
  `.review/extension.md`", with an explicit note that unrelated
  workflows are NOT evidence of Flow B. (self-review finding, warning)
- **Parity paragraph now correctly says the CI workflow only wires
  `prompt-extension-file` when the Step 5 handoff to
  `generate-extension` is accepted.** Original wording implied
  `setup` always wired it, which overstated Flow B's out-of-the-box
  behavior. (self-review finding, info)
- **Flow A row softened from "must run generate-extension" to
  "optional but recommended".** Reading the original cell literally,
  an agent might refuse to run a local review until an extension
  file exists — but Step 2.5 allows declining, and the base prompt
  alone is a supported local-only setup. (self-review finding, info)
- **Lifecycle framing above the "Two supported flows" section
  reworked to be flow-neutral.** Previously the paragraph opened
  "The four sub-skills form a lifecycle: setup installs the CI
  action…" which set a dual-surface-only mental model before an
  agent even reached the Two-supported-flows section. Now splits
  into "Dual-surface lifecycle" and "Local-only lifecycle" bullets
  so both flows are named as first-class from the top. (self-review
  note)
- **"This skill does not replace the CI action" note reframed for
  Flow A compatibility.** Original wording read as Flow-B-only and
  conflicted with the local-only flow. Now scoped explicitly: when
  paired with the CI Action (Flow B), the skill doesn't replace it;
  in Flow A the local skill IS the entire reviewer. (self-review
  note)

Content-only change to `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md` — no runtime
behavior touched, `prompt.md` unchanged, no `action.yml` surface
impact, all four sub-skills' frontmatter unchanged.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** ships a new **`open-pr` sub-skill** in the local `ai-diff-reviewer` skill pack — turns the current branch's diff into a well-documented pull request (Conventional-Commits title inference, structured body with mandatory + conditional sections, PR-template merge, `gh pr create`/`edit`) — plus a **comprehensive `docs/` audit** that corrects stale metrics across 10 files and adds dual-surface framing (GitHub Action + local companion skill) throughout the product spec, architecture, and prompts guide.

### Added
- **New `open-pr` sub-skill for the local `ai-diff-reviewer` skill
  pack** (`skills/ai-diff-reviewer/open-pr/SKILL.md`). Authors a
  well-documented pull request from the current branch's diff — infers
  a Conventional-Commits (or repo-native, empirically detected from
  recent merged PRs) title, drafts a structured body with mandatory
  Summary / Test plan / Risks and conditional Related issues /
  Screenshots / Breaking changes / Migrations / Dependencies sections
  based on diff signals, merges (never overwrites) any
  `.github/pull_request_template.md`, previews everything for a single
  yes/edit/cancel, and executes via `gh pr create` (new PR) or `gh pr
  edit` (refresh existing PR — includes body diff in the preview).
  Supports `--draft`, non-default base branches (stacked PRs), and
  degrades gracefully for fork PRs. Never pushes commits, never
  auto-merges, never fabricates issue refs / CI URLs / migration
  claims — surfaces the exact `gh` remediation and stops on any
  failure (non-blocking rule). Complements the parent skill's local
  review as the natural next step (review → fix → open the PR).
  Companion trigger phrases: "open the PR", "create a pull request",
  "write the PR body", "update the PR description", "make a draft PR".
- **Parent `ai-diff-reviewer` skill routes to `open-pr`.** Updated the
  `description` frontmatter to list four capabilities (was three);
  added activation triggers for the open-pr flow; added the
  `/ai-diff-reviewer-open-pr` slash-command hint; added an optional
  next-step hint at the end of the review flow (Step 4) suggesting
  the developer route to `open-pr` when the review comes back clean.
- **README section for `open-pr`** — "Open the pull request from the
  same diff" under `## Local review parity (companion skill)`,
  documenting the triggers, the three-mandatory / six-conditional
  section model, and the PR-template merge behavior.

### Changed
- **Comprehensive `docs/` audit for the dual-surface reality** (10
  files, +252 −66 lines, all content-only). Corrects stale metrics
  that had drifted across five minor versions and adds the local
  companion skill as a first-class architectural component:
  - **`docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`** — full rewrite. "What it is" names
    both surfaces (Action + skill) upfront. Core capabilities split
    into Shared / Action-only / Skill-only groups. New "Local
    companion skill" distribution section covers `npx skills add`.
    Roadmap replaced with an accurate v1.0.0–v1.6.0 history table +
    honest `v1.x` outlook (removed the "v1.2 raw OpenAI, v1.3
    Gemini" predictions that never landed).
  - **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — new "Two surfaces, one methodology"
    intro. Two topology diagrams (Action + Skill). New "The local
    companion skill pack" component section. Fixed the
    "AnthropicProvider (today; OpenAI/Gemini stubs)" obsolete note
    to reflect the four shipping providers.
  - **`docs/README.md`** — new "Local companion skill" section with
    pointers to all six skill-pack files.
  - **`docs/PROMPTS.md`** — added "Author a well-documented PR with
    the open-pr sub-skill" section, closing the sub-skill coverage.
  - **`docs/AI_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`** — reframed "What this repo is"
    as dual-surface; local-companion-skill task rows; hardened
    pre-PR checklist for the prompt-sync invariant and reference.md
    sync.
  - **Stale metrics corrected across 6 files:** `~2400 LOC` →
    **~4000 LOC** (`4018` exact in `scripts/reviewer.py`); `109
    tests` → **242 tests** across 4 files; repo slug
    `ai-pr-reviewer` → **`ai-diff-reviewer`** (with 301 redirect
    for back-compat pins); soft ceiling raised to `~4500 LOC` with
    "next feature triggers split" note.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** rename the Marketplace listing to **"AI Diff Reviewer"** (was "AI PR Reviewer"), which unblocks the first-time publish that had been stuck against a name-squatting org (`github.com/ai-pr-reviewer`, 0 public repos since 2024-01, blocks the slug under GitHub's global-namespace uniqueness rule). Also ships a local companion **`ai-diff-reviewer` skill** so every developer's coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf) can run the SAME review methodology locally — same prompt, same severity model, same output format — before pushing. The skill and the action share `prompts/default.md` as a single source of truth, kept in sync by a new CI invariant + an `auto-release.yml` step. Also establishes the `.review/extension.md` convention so a project's custom rules apply to both surfaces from a single file.

### Changed
- **Coordinated rename to "AI Diff Reviewer".** Two moves in the same
  release cycle to unblock the Marketplace publish:
  - **`action.yml` `name:`** — `'AI PR Reviewer'` → `'AI Diff Reviewer'`
    (Marketplace slug `ai-diff-reviewer`).
  - **GitHub repo** — `DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer` →
    `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer` (both slugs now match exactly).

  Why: the v1.4.x publish attempt failed with `Cannot match an existing
  action, user or organization name` — GitHub's name-uniqueness rule
  includes user/org names and the org `github.com/ai-pr-reviewer`
  (created 2024-01, 0 public repos) name-squats the slug at the
  org-namespace level. "AI Diff Reviewer" (verified free at both the
  Marketplace and org-namespace levels) is also more precise: this
  action reviews the `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` specifically,
  not the PR envelope (labels, description, metadata).

  **Consumer impact — none.** GitHub's permanent 301 redirect on
  renamed repos keeps every `uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1` pin
  working transparently. Published tags v1.0.0–v1.4.2 resolve to the
  new URL automatically. The `AIPRR_*` env-var prefix (private
  contract) stays unchanged. New README/example copy uses the
  canonical `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer` path. See
  [`AGENTS.md § 9`](AGENTS.md) for the full rename decision log.
- **User-facing branding updated across scripts and docs.** Log prefix
  (`[ai-pr-reviewer]` → `[ai-diff-reviewer]`), HTTP `User-Agent`
  (`ai-pr-reviewer` → `ai-diff-reviewer`), the malformed-`findings.json`
  fallback comment ("**AI PR Reviewer note:**" → "**AI Diff Reviewer
  note:**"), and every occurrence of the product name in `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `prompts/default.md`, and the
  bundled `.agents/` catalog. **HTML marker strings kept intact**
  (`<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->`, `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-state: … -->`,
  `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-provider:… -->`,
  `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-description-autocompleted -->`) — these are stable
  contracts on already-posted PR comments; renaming them would silently
  break `collapse-previous` and state detection on every existing
  consumer PR.
- **Local companion skill folder renamed** to `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`
  (was `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`) to mirror the product name. Install command
  is now `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer --skill ai-diff-reviewer`;
  vendored path is `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`. The router skill's
  `name:` frontmatter changes from `ai-diff-reviewer` to `ai-diff-reviewer`,
  and the sub-skill's from `code-review-generate-extension` to
  `ai-diff-reviewer-generate-extension`. Since the skill was introduced
  in this same release, there is no pre-existing consumer install to
  migrate.

### Fixed
- **Auto-release Step 3 now uses `git push --atomic HEAD:main $NEW_VERSION`**
  when there's a `chore(release): sync` commit to accompany the new tag.
  Prevents the partial-release state PR #26's initial `v1.5.0` cut hit —
  a branch-protection rejection on the branch push used to leave the tag
  on the remote while main (and `@v1`) stayed behind. The atomic push
  ensures both refs land together or neither does. When the atomic push
  fails, Step 3 now emits a clear error message pointing at the recovery
  playbook.
- **Auto-release Step 3 now peels the major-alias tag** with
  `git tag -f "$MAJOR_TAG" "${NEW_VERSION}^{}"` instead of the bare
  `git tag -f "$MAJOR_TAG" "$NEW_VERSION"`. Without the `^{}` peel,
  `@v1` became a nested annotated tag pointing at the `v1.X.Y` tag
  object (which then pointed at the commit), which is technically
  valid Git but confused any tooling that reads `refs/tags/v1`'s
  object SHA and expected a commit SHA. Now `@v1` is a lightweight
  tag directly at the commit — matching what a consumer running
  `git checkout v1` expects and letting the playbook's verification
  recipes cleanly compare commit SHAs.

### Added
- **`docs/RELEASE_RECOVERY.md`** — playbook for the partial-release
  failure mode above (recover the sync commit via a PR, move `@v1`,
  create the GitHub Release, refresh the vendored dogfood copy) plus the
  two long-term fixes to prevent recurrence: `AUTOMATION_GITHUB_TOKEN`
  with branch-protection bypass (recommended), or reworking Step 2.5 to
  open a PR instead of pushing directly to main. Indexed from
  `docs/README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- **First `.review/extension.md` for this repo** — generated by
  dogfooding the `ai-diff-reviewer-generate-extension` sub-skill on our
  own codebase (12+ Discovery tool calls reading AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE,
  SECURITY, STANDARDS, DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES, reviewer.py header, and
  code_check.yml before writing). ~193 lines with 17 severity overrides,
  6 "don't comment on" rules, 9 repo-specific conventions, test-strategy
  expectations, and PR-hygiene rules — all code-anchored to specific
  AGENTS.md rule numbers, file paths, or constant names (`safe_repo_path`,
  `redact_for_log`, `_CLI_ENV_ALLOWLIST`, HTML markers, etc.). Covers
  the load-bearing patterns any change to `scripts/reviewer.py` could
  regress: stdlib-only imports, subprocess/shell safety, path traversal
  routing, env-var scrubbing for CLI subprocesses, HTML-marker
  preservation, symlink hygiene, type-hint mandate, three codified
  broad-except patterns, magic numbers → constants, secret scrubbing.
- **`self-review.yml` layers `.review/extension.md` on every provider
  leg** — added `prompt-extension-file: .review/extension.md` to the
  Claude / Cursor / Codex provider matrix's `with:` block. Same file
  the local `ai-diff-reviewer` skill auto-detects, so local + CI
  reviews use one source of truth (`docs/PROMPTS.md § "Sharing
  repo-specific rules between CI and local"`). The self-review that
  ran on the PR introducing the extension was the first live use —
  meta-verification that the rules pass their own scrutiny.
- **Auto-release Step 3.5 hardening: pinned fetch + version assertion.**
  The step now runs `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@<new-tag>
  --skill ai-diff-reviewer --force` (explicit pin to the exact tag we
  just cut, not "the newest matching tag") and then asserts the
  vendored `SKILL.md`'s `version:` frontmatter equals the new tag
  before committing. Closes the failure mode where GitHub tag
  propagation lag past the 5s sleep would let `npx skills update`
  no-op silently — the pinned fetch fails loudly if the tag isn't
  visible, and the version assertion catches "fetch succeeded but
  installed the wrong content" cases. Empty diff after both checks
  pass is still treated as success (idempotent re-runs).
- **Auto-release dogfooding of the vendored companion skill.** New Step 3.5
  in [`auto-release.yml`](.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) runs
  `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@<new-tag> --skill
  ai-diff-reviewer --force` immediately after each release tag is
  pushed and commits the refreshed `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`
  + `skills-lock.json` as `chore(release): dogfood vendored
  ai-diff-reviewer to vX.Y.Z [skip release]`. Three benefits:
  - **Live smoke-test** — every release proves the just-published tag
    installs cleanly via `npx skills` on a real consumer setup (this
    repo IS a consumer). Broken installers fail here, before external
    consumers ever try to update.
  - **Cloning-parity** — anyone cloning at HEAD gets a vendored copy
    that matches the current release, not the previous one.
  - **Lockfile freshness** — the recorded content hash stays accurate
    after every release, keeping `experimental_install` restore flows
    reliable.
  Documented as Rule #10 pillar (B) in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — the
  runtime dogfooding via `self-review.yml` (pillar A) and the install-flow
  dogfooding via this step (pillar B) are now formal invariants. Also
  bans hand-editing `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/**` on feature
  branches (new DON'T #14).
- **First-time vendor of the ai-diff-reviewer skill into this repo.**
  Ran `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v1.4.2 --skill
  ai-diff-reviewer` to establish the vendored baseline (lands with
  this PR) that Step 3.5 will refresh going forward. Adds
  `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` (SKILL.md + prompt.md +
  generate-extension/ + setup/) and an entry in `skills-lock.json`
  alongside `dailybot` and `deepworkplan`.
- **Sub-skill: [`setup`](skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/SKILL.md)** —
  interactive installer for the GitHub Action itself. Walks the
  developer through six decisions (provider, strictness, trigger mode,
  external-contributor policy, PR-description mode, complexity
  labels), uses light Discovery (repo visibility, existing workflows,
  detected stack, default branch) to pre-fill sensible defaults, then
  writes a tailored `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` with only the
  inputs that differ from action defaults (so the composed workflow
  reads like a hand-written minimal file, not a config dump). Prints
  the exact GitHub Secrets URL for the chosen provider and the git
  commit-and-test steps at the end. Optionally hands off to
  `generate-extension` in Step 5 so a single conversation takes the
  developer from **zero setup → installed → tailored**. Also serves
  as the **reference manual** for every `action.yml` input via
  [`setup/reference.md`](skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md) —
  any coding agent with the skill installed can answer *"what does
  `strictness` do?"* or *"how do I pin the Cursor CLI version?"*
  without opening the action source. Wired into the parent skill's
  router table (three capabilities now) and the natural-language
  triggers ("set up ai diff reviewer for this repo", "install the ai
  diff reviewer github action", "how do I configure this?"). Documented
  in the [`README.md` § "Bootstrap the GitHub Action itself"](README.md)
  section and [`docs/PROMPTS.md`](docs/PROMPTS.md).
- **First-run bootstrap prompt in the `ai-diff-reviewer` skill** — when
  the review flow activates on a repo with no `.review/extension.md`
  (and no `.review/.skip-bootstrap` marker), the skill asks ONE
  question — **yes / no / never** — offering to route to
  `generate-extension` so the review is layered on repo-tailored
  overrides from day one. Choosing **yes** invokes the sub-skill and
  re-runs the review with the fresh extension; **no** proceeds with
  the base prompt just this once (offer fires again next time);
  **never** creates `.review/.skip-bootstrap` (a 0-byte tracked
  marker) so the offer never fires again in this repo. Committing the
  marker is the intended workflow — the whole team inherits the same
  UX. Deletion re-enables the offer. Documented in the skill's Step
  2.5, [`docs/PROMPTS.md` § "First-run bootstrap prompt"](docs/PROMPTS.md),
  and the `README.md` § "First-run bootstrap prompt" section. Trust
  boundary updated: the skill is still near read-only, but now writes
  to `.review/` in exactly two consented cases (bootstrap → extension
  file, opt-out → skip marker).
- **Sub-skill: [`generate-extension`](skills/ai-diff-reviewer/generate-extension/SKILL.md)** —
  bootstraps a repo-tailored `.review/extension.md` (or, in advanced
  mode, a full-replacement `.github/prompts/pr-review.md`) by inspecting
  the codebase for stack, architecture, security surface, existing
  conventions, and historical pain points. Mandatory Discovery phase
  (≥ 12 tool calls before writing anything) keeps the output tied to
  concrete file/module references, not generic "avoid magic numbers"
  advice. Wraps the existing meta-prompt at
  [`examples/prompts/generate-custom-prompt-meta.md`](examples/prompts/generate-custom-prompt-meta.md)
  as a proper skill so consumers don't have to copy-paste it into a
  chat window. Two output modes chosen by a single clarifying question
  (extension by default, full-replacement as advanced). Meta-prompt
  file kept for zero-install use cases (web chatbots without file-system
  access) with a header redirecting to the skill. Follows the
  `DailybotHQ/agent-skill` router-plus-sub-skills pattern used by
  `dailybot-report`, `dailybot-kudos`, etc.
- **Local companion skill: [`ai-diff-reviewer`](skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md)** —
  the same review methodology that runs on your PR in CI, now available
  locally in every coding-agent harness. Install into any consumer repo
  with `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer --skill ai-diff-reviewer`;
  vendors into `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` and pins via
  `skills-lock.json`. Uses the harness's own Read/Grep/Glob tools to
  gather context and produces the review as terminal output in the same
  format the CI bot would post (verdict + findings table + severity +
  notes + recommendation). Because `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md` is a
  byte-identical copy of `prompts/default.md` (kept in sync by
  `auto-release.yml`), pinning the same version on both surfaces
  guarantees local ↔ CI parity. Adopts the Open Agent Skills
  conventions used by `DailybotHQ/agent-skill` and
  `DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill`: YAML frontmatter with `name` /
  `description` / `version` / `documentation_url` / `user-invocable` /
  `metadata.openclaw` / `allowed-tools`, layout at
  `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the repo root so `skills.sh` discovers
  it, and no separate release cadence — the skill's version tracks
  the action tag.
- **Convention: `.review/extension.md`** for repo-specific prompt
  overrides. The new companion skill auto-detects this path (with
  `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md` as fallback for teams that
  prefer `.github/` sibling to workflow files) and layers the file's
  contents on top of the base prompt. Consumers reference the same
  path from their CI workflow's `prompt-extension-file:` input, so
  local and CI share ONE extension file with zero drift. Documented in
  [`docs/PROMPTS.md` § "Local coding-agent parity"](docs/PROMPTS.md)
  and the [`README.md` § "Local review parity"](README.md) section.
- **CI: [`scripts/validate-frontmatter.py`](scripts/validate-frontmatter.py)** —
  Python + PyYAML validator that enforces the Open Agent Skills
  contract on every `skills/**/SKILL.md`. Runs as the new
  `Skills — SKILL.md frontmatter validation` job in
  [`code_check.yml`](.github/workflows/code_check.yml). Adapted from
  `DailybotHQ/agent-skill/scripts/validate-frontmatter.py` with the
  `dailybot-` name-prefix rule dropped (this repo's skills use their
  own slug space). Runtime remains stdlib-only per AGENTS.md Rule #2
  — PyYAML is CI-only tooling.
- **CI: `Skills — prompt-sync invariant`** job in
  [`code_check.yml`](.github/workflows/code_check.yml) — fails any PR
  where `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md` has drifted from
  `prompts/default.md`, with a clear fix message pointing at
  `cp prompts/default.md skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md`. Ensures `main`
  is never in an inconsistent state between prompt edits and the next
  release cut.

### Changed
- **Auto-release now syncs skill artifacts on every version bump.** A
  new step in [`auto-release.yml`](.github/workflows/auto-release.yml)
  runs before the tag is created and (a) `sed`s the new SemVer into
  the `version:` field of every `skills/**/SKILL.md` file, and (b)
  copies `prompts/default.md` → `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md`. If the
  changes are non-empty, they're committed as
  `chore(release): sync skill artifacts for vX.Y.Z [skip release]` and
  pushed to `main` alongside the tag via `git push --follow-tags`. The
  `[skip release]` marker + the existing `chore(release):` prefix
  guard on the workflow's `if:` together prevent an infinite trigger
  loop. Consumer impact: none — the action's public contract in
  `action.yml` is untouched; only the skill artifacts inside `skills/`
  move.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** Marketplace-readiness housekeeping — root-level `SECURITY.md` so GitHub's *Report a vulnerability* discovery works out of the box, simplified security reporting channel (dropped the dead-end `CODEOWNERS` email path), and the CHANGELOG backfilled for the five same-day releases (`v1.3.1` through `v1.4.1`) whose bullets had accumulated in `[Unreleased]`. Purely docs and metadata — no runtime, `action.yml`, or workflow behavior changed.

### Added
- **Root-level [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** — Marketplace-readiness fix.
  GitHub's *Report a vulnerability* discovery flow prefers the file at
  repo root (or `.github/`); until now we only had the long-form model
  at [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md), which is the least-
  discoverable of the three canonical locations. The new root file is
  a thin pointer that carries the private-advisory reporting
  instructions, a supported-versions table (`v1.x` current major),
  and highlights that link to the long-form doc for the full trust
  model, per-provider egress surfaces, and accepted risks. The two
  files stay in sync trivially (root = pointer; `docs/` = source of
  truth).

### Changed
- **Security reporting channel simplified** in both
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).
  The prior "email the address in `CODEOWNERS`" fallback pointed at a
  file that does not exist in the repo — a dead end for reporters who
  could not use the private-advisory UI. Both files now point
  exclusively at the GitHub Security Advisory
  (`security/advisories/new`), which any GitHub account can submit
  against a public repo. No new dependency, no new attack surface
  (open-advisory URLs are already public), and no spam magnet from
  publishing a personal email in a Marketplace-facing file.

### Docs
- **CHANGELOG backfilled for [`1.3.1`](#131--2026-07-14) through
  [`1.4.1`](#141--2026-07-14)** — the auto-release workflow cuts SemVer
  tags on every merge to `main` but deliberately does **not** edit the
  changelog, so five same-day releases had accumulated their bullets
  in `[Unreleased]`. Each bullet has been redistributed to its owning
  tag section with headline notes on the `[1.4.0]` release (vendored
  Dailybot skill + full-coverage self-review + opt-in gate).
  Compare-URL footer entries added for `[1.3.1]`–`[1.4.1]` so the
  bracket-link convention is complete for every section.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Self-review dogfood promoted from `lenient` to `block-on-critical`**
  (dogfood-only, no product change). Every provider leg in
  [`.github/workflows/self-review.yml`](.github/workflows/self-review.yml)
  now passes `strictness: block-on-critical` to the action, so a `critical`
  finding on a self-review'd PR turns the check red and blocks the merge
  gate. `warning` and `info` still post inline but don't gate. This is the
  calibrated default recommended in [`docs/STRICTNESS.md`](docs/STRICTNESS.md)
  once a repo has run in `lenient` long enough to trust the model's
  severity assignments. Consumers are unaffected — the action's own
  default remains `lenient` (safe rollout) and `action.yml` is unchanged.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** vendored the Dailybot agent skill (v3.10.3) into `.agents/skills/dailybot/` and adopted the `skills.sh` lockfile mechanism (`skills-lock.json` at repo root) for pinning both vendored dogfood skills; also closed a coverage hole in the self-review dogfood so every configured provider reviews every `ready`-labeled PR regardless of diff shape. Consumer impact: **none** — the vendored skills live entirely inside `.agents/` and are invisible to the composite-action runtime; the dogfood policy is workflow-only.

### Added
- **Vendored `dailybot` agent skill (v3.10.3) + `skills-lock.json` lockfile at
  repo root.** Both vendored skills — [`.agents/skills/dailybot/`](.agents/skills/dailybot/)
  and the already-vendored [`.agents/skills/deepworkplan/`](.agents/skills/deepworkplan/) —
  are now installed and pinned via the [`skills.sh`](https://skills.sh) CLI
  (`npx skills add DailybotHQ/agent-skill --skill dailybot -y` and
  `npx skills add DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill --skill deepworkplan -y`).
  The lockfile records source repo + content hash per skill so any contributor
  can restore identical vendored copies with `npx skills experimental_install`,
  and can bump to the latest upstream release with
  `npx skills update deepworkplan dailybot`. Dailybot integration
  (progress reporting, check-ins, kudos, chat, forms, email, and per-repo API
  keys via `.dailybot/env.json` — CLI 3.7.0+) is now discoverable directly from
  `.agents/skills/dailybot/SKILL.md` without requiring a global install on the
  contributor's machine. This aligns with the existing DWP dogfood-copy pattern
  and matches the Dailybot addon in DWP's `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/addons/dailybot/`
  which expects the Dailybot agent skill ≥ 3.10.3 and CLI ≥ 3.7.0. Consumer
  impact: none — the vendored skills only ship inside this repo's `.agents/`
  tree and are invisible to users of the `DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer` action.
  Docs updated: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (Project Structure + Skills & Agents
  sections), [`.agents/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`](.agents/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md)
  (new `dailybot` row + a "Vendored skills and the lockfile" subsection with
  the common `npx skills` workflows).

### Changed
- **Self-review dogfood now runs on EVERY `ready`-labeled PR** — no more
  critical-surface filter. Previously the three CLI provider legs
  (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`) only ran when the diff touched a small
  hardcoded list of "critical" paths (`action.yml`, `scripts/reviewer.py`,
  `prompts/*`, the workflows, the main test files), and the Anthropic
  baseline was the only always-on reviewer. That optimized for cost but
  created a coverage hole: docs-only, `.agents/**` (vendored skills) and
  other AI-tooling PRs got zero review unless `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was
  configured — and when it wasn't, the merge gate failed red on legitimate
  PRs (e.g. the Dailybot-skill-vendoring PR that lit up this fix). Since
  vendored skills, workflow tweaks, prompt edits, and docs are exactly the
  surface where prompt injection or malicious content can hide, every
  configured provider now reviews every ready-labeled PR regardless of the
  diff shape. A leg is only absent from the matrix when its secret isn't
  configured on the repo. The scope job's `empty_reason` output renamed
  `no-eligible-provider` → `no-provider-secret` to match. The gate's error
  message now instructs "set at least one of ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, CURSOR_API_KEY, or OPENAI_API_KEY" rather than
  the older "configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or touch a critical surface". The
  scope job also no longer checks out the repo (nothing left to diff), so
  the decision runs faster. See
  [`.github/workflows/self-review.yml`](.github/workflows/self-review.yml)
  header comment (Design goals #2 and #3).
- **Self-review gate is now opt-in per PR** (this repo's dogfood only, no
  runtime/action.yml change). The `Self-review gate` job in
  [`.github/workflows/self-review.yml`](.github/workflows/self-review.yml) now
  runs **only when this event was a review-request** (i.e. the `scope` job
  decided a review should run — a `ready` labeling event, or `opened` with
  `ready` already present). Without a review-request event the gate is
  cleanly *Skipped* (grey) instead of red, so a docs/other PR that doesn't
  request a review no longer carries noise in the checks list; an unrelated
  `labeled` event on a PR that happens to carry `ready` also skips (avoids a
  false "no provider eligible" red on the expected empty matrix). When the
  event IS a review-request, the gate still fails hard if no provider leg
  passed (missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on a non-critical diff, or every leg
  failing). Trade-off: GitHub treats a Skipped required check as *passing*,
  so under this opt-in flow marking the gate `Required` in branch protection
  lets PRs without `ready` merge without a self-review — combine it with a
  separate rule that enforces the `ready` label (a labeler action or
  repository ruleset) if you want to force `ready` on every PR.
  [`docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md` § "Variant — opt-in gate"](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md)
  documents both flavors (strict = fail without label; opt-in = skip without
  a review-request) with the `empty_reason`-based predicate.

## [1.3.3] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **README recipe: "Require a passing review before merge (branch protection)"** —
  documents the merge-gate pattern (a stable-named job that *fails* rather than
  *skips* so a required check actually blocks the merge), cross-linked to
  [`docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md`](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).

### Changed
- **Merge gate passes when ≥1 provider leg passes** (not all). A single flaky or
  failing provider no longer blocks a merge that another provider reviewed
  cleanly — the gate counts successful `Self-review — <provider>` legs from the
  run's jobs API rather than trusting the all-or-nothing aggregate result.
- **`scope` job explains an empty matrix.** When only a CLI provider is
  configured (e.g. just `CURSOR_API_KEY`) and the diff is non-critical, it emits
  a `::notice::` clarifying that CLI legs review only critical changes and
  Anthropic is the always-on baseline — so the resulting empty matrix (and red
  merge gate) isn't a mystery. (Superseded in [1.4.0](#140--2026-07-14) when the
  critical-surface filter was removed entirely.)

## [1.3.2] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Self-review dogfood has a real merge gate.** The stable-named
  `Self-review gate` job **fails (blocks merge)** when the review ran but no
  leg passed — because GitHub's branch protection treats a *Skipped* required
  check as *passing*, so the per-leg Skipped status alone never blocked a
  merge. Mark **only** `Self-review gate` as the required check (never the
  dynamic `Self-review — <provider>` legs). Documented as a reusable consumer
  recipe in
  [`docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md` § "Recipe: run once when labelled `ready`, block merge until it passes"](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Post-release documentation polish for v1.3.0** — CHANGELOG promotion,
  Upgrade guide rewrite, and release-notes rewrite. Documentation-only; no
  behavior change to the runtime or `action.yml` contract.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** the "safe-for-open-source" release. Public-repo abuse defense (new [`author-association`](#author-association-gate-decision-table) gate, defaults ON), deterministic cost defaults for the CLI providers, Claude Code accepts a subscription OAuth token as `api-key`, Codex CLI 0.122+ auth breakage re-fixed, and the Marketplace listing goes live at [`github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-pr-reviewer`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-pr-reviewer). Consumers pinning `@v1` pick everything up automatically.

### Upgrade guide

The only behavioural change on upgrade is the new [`author-association`](#author-association-gate-decision-table) default. Public-repo consumers get safer defaults for free — private / internal teams that want to keep reviewing every PR must add one line.

| Consumer scenario | Action to take on upgrade |
|---|---|
| Public open-source repo (default) | **Nothing** — safer defaults protect your provider budget. Optionally add [`examples/open-source-safe.yml`](examples/open-source-safe.yml) for the full 3-gate hardening. |
| Private / internal repo, want to review every PR | Add `author-association: ''` (empty) to your workflow inputs to restore v1.2.x behaviour. |
| Public repo, want CONTRIBUTOR reviews too | Set `author-association: 'OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR'`. |
| Strictest — org-members only, block collaborators | Set `author-association: 'OWNER,MEMBER'`. |
| Cost-conscious (smoke-tier model) | Pin `model: claude-haiku-4-5` (Anthropic/Claude Code) or `model: gpt-5.4-mini` (Codex). |
| Claude Pro/Max subscription instead of metered API | Run `claude setup-token` locally, store the `sk-ant-oat…` token as a secret, pass it as `api-key` (see [`docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Billing Claude Code against a subscription"](docs/PROVIDERS.md)). |

<a id="author-association-gate-decision-table"></a>

**`author-association` gate — recommended value per repo type:**

| Repo type | Recommended value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Public open-source (default) | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` | Safe default. Blocks external contributors' PRs before any LLM call — closes the LLM-budget-abuse vector where an attacker opens N PRs to burn your provider tokens. |
| Public + selective external | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR` | Adds returning contributors (anyone with a merged PR in the repo's history). |
| Private / internal team | `''` (empty — gate disabled) | Every PR is trusted; the abuse vector doesn't apply. |
| Security-critical / regulated | `OWNER,MEMBER` | Strictest. Collaborators (invited-but-not-org-members) are also gated out. |
| Fork-heavy monorepo | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` **+** `permissions: pull-requests: write` on trusted-fork workflow only | Combine with [`pull_request_target`](docs/SECURITY.md) hardening. |

Full threat model + per-value semantics: [`docs/SECURITY.md` § "Author-association gate"](docs/SECURITY.md).

### Added
- **Claude Code subscription auth** — `provider: claude-code` now accepts a Claude Pro/Max OAuth token as `api-key`, parallel to Cursor's subscription model. Run `claude setup-token` on a logged-in machine, store the `sk-ant-oat…` token as a secret, and the action detects the prefix and forwards it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription billing). Normal `sk-ant-api…` keys still forward as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (metered) — no new input. **Security caveat:** subscription tokens grant broader account access than a scoped key; use only with `persist-credentials: false` on non-fork PRs. Codex has no clean CI equivalent (its ChatGPT-mode OAuth flow is interactive with rotating tokens and likely violates OpenAI's automation terms), so it stays on API-key auth. See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Billing Claude Code against a subscription"](docs/PROVIDERS.md).
- **New [`author-association`](#author-association-gate-decision-table) input** — comma-separated whitelist of GitHub `pull_request.author_association` values allowed to trigger a review. Defaults to `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` (the safe baseline for public repos). Reads a webhook-payload field the PR author cannot spoof and short-circuits *before* any LLM API call. Composes AND-style with `label-gate` and `trigger-mode` and is evaluated *first* (cheapest gate). Case- and whitespace-insensitive; empty string disables the gate. See [`docs/SECURITY.md` § "Author-association gate"](docs/SECURITY.md) and the ready-to-copy [`examples/open-source-safe.yml`](examples/open-source-safe.yml).

### Fixed
- **Agent-runner recovery from malformed `findings.json`.** PR #11 exposed the failure with `codex-cli 0.144.4`: Codex completed the review and wrote a useful Markdown summary, but one inline-finding string was invalid JSON, so the parser raised `Malformed findings.json` and the job failed. The subprocess boundary now enables an explicit summary-only fallback — malformed finding objects are dropped, the recovered summary is posted with a note, the run logs a warning. Direct parser calls remain strict by default.
- **`provider: codex` — 401 Missing bearer / basic authentication.** Codex CLI 0.122+ stopped reading `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment and now reads credentials **only** from `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`. `codex-cli 0.144.3` (currently on npm) hit this breakage: every `codex exec` reached `api.openai.com/v1/responses` with an empty `Authorization` header and 401'd. `CodexProvider` now materializes an apikey-mode `auth.json` (`{"OPENAI_API_KEY": "..."}`) in an isolated per-run `CODEX_HOME` (`tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="aiprr-codex-")`, mode `0700`, file mode `0600`) before each invocation and removes the whole tempdir in a `finally` block after. `OPENAI_API_KEY` continues to be forwarded for back-compat with Codex < 0.122. Regression tests in `CodexAuthJsonTests` cover env forwarding, on-disk file shape, permission modes, and cleanup. See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Codex auth model (0.122+ requires `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`)"](docs/PROVIDERS.md).
- **`provider: codex` no longer copies ignored MCP JSON config.** After switching Codex auth to an isolated per-run `CODEX_HOME`, the old `mcp-config-file` copy still targeted `~/.codex/mcp.json`, which the subprocess ignored and Codex does not read anyway (`config.toml` is the supported path). The Codex provider now warns without copying the ignored JSON file; use `agent-extra-args` / `config.toml` for Codex MCP setup.

### Changed
- **Marketplace listing renamed back to "AI PR Reviewer"** (`action.yml` `name:` reverted from the v1.2.1 `Dailybot AI PR Reviewer`). The v1.2.1 vendor prefix was a defensive over-fix — the real slug collision (`ai-pull-request-reviewer`, owned by the third-party `appchoose/ai-pr-review`) was on the *full-form* title only. The *abbreviated* title "AI PR Reviewer" slugifies to `ai-pr-reviewer`, a distinct slug that appeared free at the time (Marketplace listing search only — the org-level `github.com/ai-pr-reviewer` collision that later blocked the v1.5.0 publish wasn't discovered until 2026-07-14). Marketplace URL was staged at [`github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-pr-reviewer`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-pr-reviewer); workflow `uses:` pins are unaffected. Vendor attribution continues via the `author: 'DailybotHQ'` field, which GitHub auto-renders as "by DailybotHQ" beneath the tile. **No consumer action required.** See [`AGENTS.md § 9`](AGENTS.md) for the full naming history including the v1.5.0 final rename to `AI Diff Reviewer`.
- **Default behaviour tightening (soft-breaking) — `author-association: OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR`.** External-contributor PRs (`author_association` = `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIMER`, `NONE`) are **no longer reviewed automatically** after upgrading. Public-repo consumers get safer defaults for free; consumers who want v1.2.x behaviour set `author-association: ''`. The SemVer minor bump reflects that the behavioural change is opt-out. See the [Upgrade guide](#upgrade-guide) above for per-repo-type guidance.
- **Explicit, quality-tier default models for the CLI providers.** The CLI providers no longer default to `auto` (which deferred to the account default and could silently be Opus at ≈$5/$25). The action now pins an explicit quality-tier model per provider: **`claude-code` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`** (quality/price sweet spot); **`codex` → `gpt-5.6-luna`** (≈$1/$6 per 1M tokens; current-gen budget model, replaces the now-deprecated `gpt-5-codex` at ≈$1.75/$14). The `anthropic` default stays `claude-sonnet-4-6` and Cursor stays `auto` (flat-rate/unlimited on Pro). Consumers pin a cheaper smoke model (`claude-haiku-4-5` ≈$1/$5, `gpt-5.4-mini` ≈$0.75/$4.50) via `model:`. See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Choosing a cost-efficient model"](docs/PROVIDERS.md).
- **Label matching is now case-insensitive.** `label-gate` (and its `label-once` / `label-added-only` trigger logic) compares label names on a lowercased, whitespace-trimmed basis — `label-gate: ready` is satisfied by `ready`, `Ready`, or `READY`. Applies to `resolve_trigger_action`, `gh_pr_has_label`, and `count_label_events`; removes a foot-gun where a capitalized label silently failed to trigger.
- **Self-review dogfooding is now cost-scoped, model-pinned, and label-gated.** Three complementary changes bound dogfood spend: (1) the `anthropic` leg is the always-on smoke baseline with `max-turns: 12` (down from the consumer default `30`); the `claude-code`, `cursor`, and `codex` legs only fire when the diff touches provider-sensitive surfaces (`action.yml`, `scripts/reviewer.py`, prompts, core workflow files, or provider/runtime tests); (2) each leg pins an explicit cheap model — Anthropic and Claude Code on `claude-haiku-4-5`, Codex on `gpt-5.4-mini`, Cursor on `auto` (unlimited on Pro); (3) the whole dogfood is gated on a `ready` label + `trigger-mode: label-once`, so the maintainer holds explicit control of dogfood spend. Routine docs/README PRs stay cheap while full provider parity is still exercised on the changes that can realistically break it.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-14

**Headline:** the "actually-works-on-Marketplace" release — renames the Marketplace listing to unblock the first-time publish (a squatting `appchoose/ai-pr-review` action already owns the un-prefixed slug) and ships two provider-side fix batches that landed on `main` after `v1.2.0` was tagged (`claude-code` and `codex` were both broken out of the box in `v1.2.0`; this patch is what makes those providers actually usable). Consumers pinning `@v1` pick everything up automatically.

### Changed
- **Marketplace listing renamed to "Dailybot AI PR Reviewer"** (`action.yml` `name:`). The un-prefixed name was mis-diagnosed as slug-ifying to `ai-pull-request-reviewer`, which is claimed by an unrelated third-party action (`appchoose/ai-pr-review`, v1.1.5). The vendor-prefix pattern was the assumed Marketplace resolution and kept the repo slug, docs, and user-facing product copy on "AI PR Reviewer". This was reverted in v1.3.0 after re-checking Marketplace slug availability. No workflow changes required — `uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1` is unaffected.
- **Default Cursor model is now `auto`** (was `composer-2.5`). `auto` is unlimited on Cursor Pro plans and is the CI recommendation in `docs/PROVIDERS.md`; the default now matches the docs. Pin `composer-2.5` (or any specific model) via `model:` if you want to force one.
- **`collapse-previous` is now scoped per provider.** Every review body and tracking comment carries an invisible `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-provider: <id> -->` marker, and `collapse-previous` only minimizes *this provider's own* prior artefacts. Effects: (1) several providers can review the same PR concurrently — even sharing one `GITHUB_TOKEN` — without collapsing each other (`self-review.yml`'s four-provider matrix keeps the default `true` and relies on the scoping); (2) unrelated `github-actions[bot]` comments (coverage bots, labelers) are no longer collapsed. See `docs/PROVIDERS.md` § "Running more than one provider on the same PR". Transition: a single pre-upgrade review without the marker won't be auto-collapsed on the first run after upgrading.
- **`agent-max-turns` now warns instead of silently doing nothing** for the CLI providers. None of the shipping CLIs (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) expose a turn-count cap flag, so the input can't be forwarded; the run logs a clear warning pointing at `agent-extra-args` and noting the `CLI_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` (900 s) as the effective bound, rather than leaving a misleading dead input.

### Fixed
- **`provider: claude-code` and `provider: codex` now actually produce reviews.** Both were broken out of the box and failed on essentially every PR:
  - **Claude Code** received its review rubric + `findings.json` output contract as a literal *file path* (`--append-system-prompt <path>`) instead of text, so the instructions never reached the model — it was never told to write findings and the run failed with `FileNotFoundError`. Now the instructions are passed as text via `--append-system-prompt`.
  - **Claude Code** ran in the default headless permission mode, which denies the `Write` tool in non-interactive CI, so it could not emit `findings.json` even when instructed. Now invoked with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (the runner is already an isolated ephemeral sandbox; mirrors Cursor's `--force --trust`).
  - **Codex** ran `codex exec` in its default read-only sandbox and physically could not write `findings.json`. Now invoked with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (documented for externally-sandboxed CI environments).
- **Large PRs no longer crash `claude-code` / `codex` with `E2BIG`.** Both embedded the full diff (up to 200 KB) in a single argv argument, exceeding the Linux ~128 KB per-argument limit. The prompt is now piped via stdin (`claude -p` reads stdin; `codex exec -`), matching the fix Cursor already had.
- **Agent-runner prompt hygiene.** The user prompt handed to the CLI providers referenced the chat-completions-only tools `post_inline_comment` / `submit_review`, which don't exist for a vendor CLI. Agent-runner providers now get a tailored prompt that points at the `findings.json` output contract instead of contradictory tool names.
- **Claude Code MCP passthrough now takes effect.** `mcp-config-file` was copied to `~/.claude/mcp.json`, which Claude Code does not read — the passthrough silently did nothing. The CLI is now invoked with `--mcp-config <file>` pointing at the consumer's config.
- **Codex MCP passthrough now warns instead of silently no-op'ing.** Codex configures MCP via `~/.codex/config.toml`, not a JSON file, so `mcp-config-file` never took effect for `provider: codex`. The run now logs a clear warning pointing at `agent-extra-args` / `config.toml` instead of pretending it worked. (Full Codex MCP support is a documented follow-up.)
- **Vendor CLIs now inherit proxy and custom-endpoint config.** `_build_cli_env` forwards `HTTP(S)_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (non-secret network config) so agent-runner providers work on proxied / self-hosted runners and against compatible gateways.

### Security
- **`docs/SECURITY.md`** now documents the real exfiltration surface of the agent-runner providers (vendor API key in the CLI subprocess env + `GITHUB_TOKEN` persisted by `actions/checkout` in `.git/config`, both reachable by an injected CLI) and corrects the prior blast-radius claim, which only held for `provider: anthropic`. Recommends running agent-runner providers on trusted/non-fork PRs only and setting `persist-credentials: false`.
- **Runtime secret scrubbing.** The provider API key and GitHub token are registered as literal secret values (`register_secret`) and scrubbed (`scrub_secrets`) from the review summary, every inline-comment body, and any failure message before it is posted to the PR — a defense-in-depth backstop against a prompt-injected vendor CLI echoing its key into a public comment.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-11

**Headline:** the "configurable review workflow" release — five new inputs that let consumers control when the review fires, how the prompt is composed, whether the PR description is auto-completed, whether complexity labels are applied, and a fourth strictness tier for zero-tolerance stacks. Every knob is additive and opt-in; consumers on `@v1` see zero behavioural drift.

### Added
- **New `trigger-mode` input** with four values: `always`, `label-required`, `label-once`, `label-added-only`. Enables precise control over when the reviewer runs — including a "review once per label application" workflow where re-running requires toggling the label off and on. See [`docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md`](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).
- New helpers `count_label_events`, `resolve_trigger_action`, `read_trigger_state`, `write_trigger_state`. Marker state (a JSON blob in an HTML comment inside the tracking comment) carries the `label_toggle_generation` counter that powers `label-once`.
- **New `pr-description-mode` input** with four values: `off` (default), `warn`, `block`, `autocomplete`. When `autocomplete` is used, the AI writes a first-draft PR body when the current body is missing or too vague. Guarded by a marker so it never overwrites maintainer edits. See [`docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md`](docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md).
- **New `pr-description-min-length` input** (default `50`) — character threshold below which the body is treated as "missing/vague."
- **New `complexity-labels-enabled` input** — when `true`, the reviewer assesses PR complexity (`low`/`medium`/`high`) based on cognitive load, files touched, security surface, and coverage delta, then applies a `complexity:*` label.
- **New `complexity-label-prefix` input** (default `complexity:`) — configurable prefix for the applied complexity label.
- **New `set_pr_description` and `set_pr_complexity` tools** in the chat-completions tool schema, gated by the new inputs (exposed only when the corresponding feature is enabled).
- New GitHub API surface used: `PATCH /pulls/{n}` (autocomplete) and `DELETE /issues/{n}/labels/<name>` (complexity relabelling). See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) § "PR metadata PATCH surface" for the threat model.
- **New `prompt-extension-file` input** — APPENDS content to the base system prompt (either the bundled default or a custom `prompt-file`) with a `---` separator. Layer stack-specific severity overrides and house rules without copy-pasting the entire default. Three starter extensions ship in `examples/prompts/` (`python-strict.md`, `typescript-strict.md`, `security-focused.md`).
- **Meta-prompt** at `examples/prompts/generate-custom-prompt-meta.md` — hand it to your favorite coding AI (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini) with your repo checked out, and the AI produces a repo-tailored `prompt-file`. Solves the blank-page problem for the full-replacement path.
- **New strictness mode `block-on-any`** — fails the GitHub check when the reviewer posts any inline comment, including `info`. Zero-tolerance mode for security-critical and regulated stacks. See [`docs/STRICTNESS.md`](docs/STRICTNESS.md) for the full decision tree.
- Documentation of the Cursor CLI billing model in `docs/PROVIDERS.md` (subscription-only, no BYOK, `model: auto` unlimited on Pro plans) — resolves consumer confusion about which API keys are compatible with `provider: cursor`.

### Changed
- `label-gate` semantics preserved for back-compat, now internally implemented as `trigger-mode: label-required` with `label-gate` supplying the label name. Consumers that only set `label-gate` see zero behavioural drift.
- `CursorProvider` now passes `--force --trust` by default in its headless invocation, per Cursor's own [Headless CLI docs](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/headless) recommendation for CI. Adds `--approve-mcps` conditionally when `mcp-config-file` is set, so the interactive MCP-approval prompt does not stall unattended runs. Consumers do not need to add these flags manually via `agent-extra-args`; the change is fully backward-compatible.
- `examples/provider-cursor.yml` now sets `model: auto` explicitly as the recommended CI default.
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` § "Two performance shapes" — added a Billing row clarifying that Cursor consumes subscription credits while other agent-runner providers use metered vendor API tokens.

### Fixed
- **CursorProvider E2BIG on large PRs.** The Cursor CLI concatenated review instructions + PR diff and passed the whole string as a positional argv token (`cursor-agent -p <200 KB…>`), which exceeded the Linux `ARG_MAX` (~128 KB) and crashed the review before the CLI could start (`OSError: [Errno 7] Argument list too long`). `_invoke_cli_agent()` now accepts an optional `stdin_input=` parameter; `CursorProvider.run_review()` pipes the prompt via stdin (`cursor-agent -p` with no positional argument), unblocking reviews of PRs whose diff alone can exceed 200 KB. Regression covered by `CursorHeadlessDefaultsTests.test_user_prompt_not_in_argv_and_goes_via_stdin`.
- Other providers (`anthropic`, `claude-code`, `codex`) were unaffected — Claude Code writes the system prompt to a file via `--append-system-prompt` and Codex's prompt shape stays under `ARG_MAX` in practice.
- **`label-added-only` no longer fires on unrelated labels.** When `label-gate` was already present on a PR and a webhook added a different label (e.g. `bug` or a Dependabot label), the workflow would still enter this action and pay for a full review. `_read_github_event_label()` now surfaces `event.label.name`; `resolve_trigger_action()` requires it to match `label-gate` in `label-added-only` mode. Consumers relying on `label-added-only` avoid stray runs and stray billing. Regression covered by `ResolveTriggerActionTests.test_label_added_only_skips_when_event_label_is_unrelated`.
- **Silent no-op on agent-runner providers now logs a `WARNING`.** Enabling `pr-description-mode: autocomplete` or `complexity-labels-enabled: true` with `provider: cursor|claude-code|codex` never populated the corresponding `state.proposed_*` fields (the tools are chat-completions-only in v1.2). Consumers used to pay for a review with nothing to show for those inputs. `main()` now emits a `WARNING:` line at run start listing which inputs will no-op, and `docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md` § "Provider support matrix" documents the current split. Extracted into a testable helper `build_agent_runner_noop_warning()`.
- **`label-once` no longer skips silently when `count_label_events()` returns 0.** Previously `label_toggle_generation <= last_reviewed_generation` treated `0 <= 0` as "already reviewed" — so a transient timeline-API failure while the gate label WAS on the PR caused a silent skip with `should_run=False (already reviewed label generation 0 …)`. The check now requires `label_toggle_generation > 0` before treating a run as stale. Better to run and deliver a review than skip and deliver nothing. Regression covered by `ResolveTriggerActionTests.test_label_once_runs_when_count_zero_but_label_present`.
- **`count_label_events()` now logs a `WARNING` when the 20-page pagination cap is hit.** On long-lived, high-chatter PRs the safety bound could undercount the generation, and `label-once` re-runs would silently refuse to fire. The cap stays (cost control), but now announces itself so operators see why the mode is stuck. Documented workarounds in `docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md` § "Edge cases": toggle the label twice, or switch to `label-added-only` for that PR. Regression covered by `CountLabelEventsTests.test_logs_warning_when_pagination_cap_hit`.
- **README `prompt-extension-file` comment.** The recipe said the input was "mutually exclusive with `prompt-file`, or complementary" — the two are actually composable ("custom base + extension"). Comment rewritten to match `docs/PROMPTS.md` and `action.yml`.
- **`collapse-previous` silently failed on `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`.** `gh_get_authenticated_login()` unconditionally called `GET /user`, which returns `403 Forbidden` for the built-in workflow installation token (a well-known GitHub limitation). The exception was swallowed by the outer try/except and logged as non-fatal, meaning the entire `minimizeComment` GraphQL step never ran — every consumer using the recommended `github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` pattern lost the "hide previous reviews as outdated" feature since v1.0, without noticing. The function now walks a 4-tier fallback chain: (1) `/user` for PATs, (2) `/app` for GitHub App tokens (returns `<slug>[bot]`), (3) marker-scan the PR's issue comments for `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->` and use that comment's author, (4) hardcoded default `github-actions[bot]`. Regression covered by seven `GhGetAuthenticatedLoginFallbackTests` cases across all four tiers plus the empty-login edge case. New public constant `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_BOT_LOGIN`.
- **`collapse-previous` login-shape mismatch between REST and GraphQL.** Even with the 4-tier fallback landed, the dogfood run logged `Collapsed 0/N previous bot artefact(s)` because REST returns `.user.login = "github-actions[bot]"` while GraphQL returns `.author.login = "github-actions"` (no `[bot]` suffix) on the same Bot node. The naive equality check filtered every bot artefact out. The filter now accepts both shapes for the comparison (`bot_login` and `bot_login` stripped of the `[bot]` suffix). Regression covered by four `GhCollapsePreviousReviewsTests` cases — matches without suffix, matches with suffix, skips already-minimized nodes, ignores other bots (dependabot/renovate stay untouched).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-05

**Headline:** three new agent-runner providers (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`) alongside the incumbent `anthropic` chat-completions provider — zero migration cost for consumers on `@v1`. See [`.dwp/plans/PLAN_multi_cli_provider_expansion/analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md`](.dwp/plans/PLAN_multi_cli_provider_expansion/analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md) for the full breakdown.

### Added
- **Multi-CLI provider expansion** — three new agent-runner providers that shell out to their vendor's coding-agent CLI in headless mode and receive findings via a file-based contract (`.aiprr/findings.json`):
  - `provider: claude-code` — installs `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` via npm; auth via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
  - `provider: cursor` — installs `cursor-agent` via `curl` (`cursor.com/install`); auth via `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
  - `provider: codex` — installs `@openai/codex` via npm; auth via `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- New abstract `AgentRunnerProvider` peer of `Provider`. `build_provider()` now returns either family; `main()` dispatches on `isinstance`.
- New `Finding` + `ReviewResult` dataclasses provide the provider-independent submission-path payload.
- New `parse_findings_file()` parser + validator with strict schema enforcement (required fields, allowed severity/side enums, forward-compat with vendor extensions).
- New `write_findings_prompt_directive()` — standardises the "write your findings here" instruction appended to review prompts across all CLI providers.
- New optional inputs: `agent-max-turns`, `agent-extra-args`, `mcp-config-file`, `claude-code-version`, `cursor-version`, `codex-version`.
- Modular install in `action.yml`: each CLI install step is guarded by `if: inputs.provider == '...'`, so consumers picking the default `provider: anthropic` pay zero install overhead. One provider = one install.
- MCP servers passthrough: `mcp-config-file` copies the consumer's JSON config into the CLI's expected location (with round-trip backup) before invocation.
- New examples: `provider-claude-code.yml`, `provider-cursor.yml`, `provider-codex.yml`, `mcp-passthrough.yml`.
- New CI job `cli-install-smoke` — matrix over the three CLI providers exercising each installer script on a fresh runner, catching installer drift before it reaches consumers.
- Dogfooding matrix in `.github/workflows/self-review.yml` — every PR to this repo now runs a 4-leg review (`anthropic`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`) with per-provider `self-reviewed:*` labels.
- 67 new unit tests (109 total, up from 42) covering: adapter (state → ReviewResult), findings.json parser (happy + error paths), provider dispatch, MCP passthrough, subprocess boundary, security invariants (no `shell=True`, no `os.system`, all `extra_args` funnel through `shlex.split`), CLI env allowlist, and end-to-end serialization roundtrips across both provider families.

### Changed
- `gh_submit_review_with_fallback()` now accepts a `ReviewResult` (was: `body` + `inline_comments`). The submission path is provider-agnostic; findings are encoded to the GitHub Reviews inline shape at the boundary via `findings_to_gh_inline_comments()`.
- Refreshed `docs/PROVIDERS.md` with the Agent Runner Provider Contract section documenting the schema, validation, and prompt directive.
- Refreshed `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with the two-provider-family design decision and the modular-install approach.
- Refreshed `README.md` inputs table + provider roadmap with the four shipping providers, categorised by family.
- Refreshed `.agents/agents/provider-implementer.md`, `.agents/skills/add-provider/SKILL.md`, `.agents/agents/reviewer.md`, and `.agents/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md` for the two-family model.

### Fixed
- N/A — additive release. Existing `provider: anthropic` consumers see zero behavioural drift.

### Security
- `_invoke_cli_agent()` enforces argv-list subprocess invocation (no `shell=True`).
- All consumer-provided `agent-extra-args` are parsed with `shlex.split` before being appended to the CLI invocation.
- MCP config passthrough uses `shutil.copyfile` (not `shell=True` copy) and round-trips any pre-existing user config so an interrupted run doesn't leave stale state.
- **New `_build_cli_env(extra_vars=...)` helper** — vendor CLI subprocesses receive an explicit env allowlist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `NODE_PATH`, locale, runner metadata) plus the vendor API key only. `AIPRR_GH_TOKEN` and all other `AIPRR_*` variables stay in the parent process; enforced by static `CliEnvAllowlistTests`. Addresses Security-Review Finding #2.
- **`max-inline-comments` cap now enforced on the agent-runner path** — previously only enforced by the chat-completions tool handler. `main()` truncates `result.findings` to `max_inline_comments` after `provider.run_review()` and recomputes `overall_severity` on the retained subset. Addresses Security-Review Finding #1.
- **Documented accepted risks** in `docs/SECURITY.md`: (a) Cursor installer supply chain (`curl | bash`, no signed installer offered by vendor); (b) MCP config persistence after SIGKILL on self-hosted persistent runners.

### CI
- `code_check.yml` gains a `cli-install-smoke` matrix job (claude-code / cursor / codex).
- `self-review.yml` becomes a 4-leg matrix; `fail-fast: false` + `timeout-minutes: 25`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-29

Initial public release.

### Added
- Composite GitHub Action that runs an LLM-driven code review on every pull request.
- Anthropic provider (`claude-sonnet-4-6` default), with `Provider` abstraction ready for OpenAI/Gemini drop-ins.
- Five-tool agentic loop: `read_file`, `grep`, `glob`, `post_inline_comment`, `submit_review`.
- Severity tagging (`critical` / `warning` / `info`) on every inline comment, surfaced as the `severity` action output.
- Three strictness modes (`lenient`, `block-on-critical`, `block-on-warning`) to gate the GitHub check.
- Optional `label-gate` input — only run when the PR carries a configured label.
- Optional `applied-label` input — auto-apply a label after a successful, non-blocked review (with auto-create if the label doesn't exist).
- Auto-collapse of previous bot reviews/comments via GraphQL `minimizeComment`.
- Tracking spinner comment with `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->` marker, transitioning in-place from `Working…` to `View review →` (or `failed`).
- 422 fallback: if GitHub rejects the review because one inline comment anchored outside the diff, the action retries summary-only instead of losing every comment.
- Bundled default system prompt that's technology-agnostic and includes severity definitions.
- Bounded retries on Anthropic 429/5xx; bounded conversation pruning to keep token cost from compounding.
- Documentation: README, PROMPTS guide, STRICTNESS guide, PROVIDERS roadmap.
- Examples: `basic.yml`, `label-gated.yml`, `strict.yml`, `custom-prompt.yml`.
- `code_check` workflow gating every PR/push to `main` (compile, `action.yml`
  contract validation, actionlint, unit tests).
- `auto-release` workflow: SemVer bump from Conventional Commits on merge to
  `main`, tag + major-alias move + GitHub Release (tag-only, no commit to
  protected `main`).
- Stdlib-`unittest` test suite under `tests/` for the runtime's pure logic.
- Self-review workflow dogfooding the action on its own PRs.
- Repo hygiene: issue/PR templates and Dependabot for GitHub Actions.
