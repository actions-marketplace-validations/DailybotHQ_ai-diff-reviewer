# Standards

Repository conventions that apply across all contributions. For Python-specific guidelines see [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md). For documentation see [DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md](DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md). The non-negotiables also live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Branding and naming

- **Product name (user-facing):** "AI Diff Reviewer". Capitalise exactly that way in user-facing copy (README, docs, marketplace listing, error messages, comments visible to users).
- **Slug:** `ai-diff-reviewer` (lowercase, hyphenated) — matches both the GitHub repo (`DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer`) and the Marketplace listing. The old `ai-pr-reviewer` slug still resolves via GitHub's permanent 301 redirect on renamed repos, so pre-rename `uses:` pins keep working; new copy-paste examples should always use the canonical slug.
- **Env-var prefix:** `AIPRR_` (private contract, unchanged across the rename — internal only, but stable because it's referenced in local-dev docs and `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- **Marker constants:** `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->`, `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-state: … -->`, `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-provider:… -->`, `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-description-autocompleted -->`, and (v2.1.0+) the per-inline-comment `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-finding: fp=… sev=… -->` — deliberately preserved as-is across the rename so already-posted PR tracking comments and inline findings continue to be detected by `collapse-previous`, state-lookup and incremental-review logic.

Don't invent variants like "AI-Diff-Reviewer", "AIDR", "AiDiffReviewer", "AI PR Reviewer" (the old name), etc. The single canonical capitalisation makes search consistent across the marketplace, GitHub, and docs.

## Commits

Conventional Commits. Format:

```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <short description>

## Summary
<1–2 sentences — the why, not the what>

## Change Log
- <bullet 1>
- <bullet 2>

## Risks
- <risk 1, or "None — content-only change">
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`. Scope is optional; common scopes:

- `provider` — additions to `Provider` implementations
- `prompt` — changes to `prompts/default.md`
- `action` — changes to `action.yml`
- `runtime` — changes to `scripts/reviewer.py`
- `docs` — documentation
- `ci` — workflow or release tooling

### Example commit message

```
feat(provider): add OpenAI provider

## Summary
First non-Anthropic provider — translates Anthropic-shape messages and
tool calls to OpenAI's chat-completions schema at the boundary so the
rest of the runtime is unchanged.

## Change Log
- New OpenAIProvider class with tool-call translation in both directions
- New default model entry: openai → gpt-4o
- New optional input api-base for self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints

## Risks
- Translation layer is the only meaningful new surface; covered by smoke
  test on PR #42 (provider: openai). No change to existing Anthropic path.
```

## Branch names

`<type>/<short-kebab-description>`, where `<type>` matches the commit type. Examples:

- `feat/openai-provider`
- `fix/422-fallback-empty-comments`
- `docs/strictness-rewrite`

Keep branch names short. Long branches show up in `gh pr view` and break terminal layouts.

## Pull requests

- Title in Conventional Commits format (the same as the squash-merge subject).
- Description follows the same `## Summary / ## Change Log / ## Risks` structure as commits.
- Link to any related issue (`Fixes #123`).
- Reference the self-review run that validated the change (or describe the manual verification if dogfooding can't cover it).

## File layout

- **Runtime:** `scripts/reviewer.py`. One file. Add helpers as functions, not new files, unless adding a new file is unavoidable (e.g. provider-specific code that's >300 LOC and warrants isolation — even then, prefer a single file). The four v1.1.0 CLI provider impls each stayed well under that budget by sharing the `_invoke_cli_agent` / `_build_cli_env` helpers rather than each rolling their own.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_<area>.py`. Split by concern (core, findings parser, agent-runner providers, roundtrip). See [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md#test-discipline).
- **Default prompt:** `prompts/default.md`. Keep one. Don't fork into multiple defaults.
- **User-facing docs:** `docs/STRICTNESS.md`, `docs/PROMPTS.md`, `docs/PROVIDERS.md`. Each ~300–500 lines max; split if longer.
- **Contributor docs:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, etc.
- **Examples:** `examples/<scenario>.yml`. One file per scenario, with comments explaining the intent. Keep them runnable as-is — they pin `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v2`.
- **AI-agent config:** `.agents/`. Edit there, never at `.claude/...`. The `.claude` symlink is for back-compat only.

## English only

All code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and PR descriptions are in English. The action ships globally; a Spanish (or any non-English) artefact is a usability bug for everyone outside that language.

## File size

- `scripts/reviewer.py` — one file, ~10k LOC as of v2.1.0. The historical ~4500 LOC soft ceiling was crossed deliberately by the runner × backend work, and the **decision (2026-09-16)** is: keep the single file for the rest of the v2.x line — zero-install composite action, one artefact to audit, `python3 scripts/reviewer.py` for local debugging are product features. The split is a v3.0 change with its own Deep Work Plan (a stdlib-only `scripts/aiprr/` package with `scripts/reviewer.py` as a thin entry shim; compile-all gate; prompt-sync and vendored-skill invariants unchanged). Until then, no new subsystem lands as more lines in the single file without a module plan in its PR description; reviewers treat size creep as `info` (`.review/extension.md`).
- Doc files — under 500 lines. Long docs are signal that they need to be split.
- Examples — under 50 lines each. They're showcase, not reference.
- Test files — under 500 lines. Split by concern rather than growing an existing file (v2.1.0's agent-runner and backend modules are the model: core / hardening / CLI invocations / Cursor / custom backends / Grok + snapshots; `api-base` / requests / matrix). Recorded debt above the line as of 2026-09-16: `test_reviewer.py` (2,623), `test_iar_observability.py` (1,419), `test_iar_state_layer.py` (885), `test_iar_dispatch.py` (608), `test_iar_dedup.py` (541), `test_iar_generation_tracking.py` (526) — pre-v2.1.0 files, split when next touched substantially; not a per-PR blocker (`info`).

## Whitespace and formatting

- 4-space indentation, no tabs. Python convention.
- LF line endings. CRLF causes spurious diffs on Linux runners.
- Trailing newline at end of file.
- No trailing whitespace.
- Markdown: 80-char soft limit on prose lines (improves diff readability); code blocks and tables can extend.

CI doesn't enforce these rigidly; the formatter you use locally should produce them by default. We don't add `prettier` / `black` to CI for the reasons in [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md).

## Comments in code

- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. The `what` should be obvious from the code.
- Single-line comments preferred. Multi-line block comments are reserved for module/section headers (the `# ---` separators in `scripts/reviewer.py`).
- Reference issues or PRs by number when documenting a workaround for a specific external bug (e.g. `# upstream issue: anthropic/claude-code-action#5`).
- Don't write comments like `# TODO: ...` without a tracking issue. If it's worth flagging, it's worth filing.

## Tests

See [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md). The summary:

- `py_compile` is the static gate.
- `actionlint` is the workflow gate.
- The stdlib `unittest` suite in `tests/` is the unit gate (720 tests across 17 files as of v2.1.0, no third-party deps).
- `cli-install-smoke` is the CLI-installer gate (matrix over the four agent-runner providers: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`, `grok`).
- `self-review.yml` is the integration gate (always-on Anthropic baseline plus scoped CLI-provider dogfooding for provider-sensitive changes).

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). The summary:

- Stdlib runtime, zero external deps.
- All paths through `safe_repo_path()`.
- No `shell=True` in subprocess; `shlex.split()` on any user-provided arg string; `_build_cli_env()` scrubs the vendor-CLI environment via `_CLI_ENV_ALLOWLIST`.
- Tool args logged with `redact_for_log()`.
- Vulnerabilities reported via private GitHub security advisory.

## Documentation

See [DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md](DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md). The summary:

- README is marketplace-facing — short, scannable, one quick-start, full input table.
- `docs/` splits user-facing (STRICTNESS, PROMPTS, PROVIDERS) from contributor-facing (ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, TESTING_GUIDE, etc.).
- `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth that every other doc points back to.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` honest. One entry per behaviour change.

## Versioning

SemVer. Tags `vX.Y.Z`. The moving major tag for the current line (`v2`) auto-updates on every `v2.x.y` publish via `release.yml`. Don't delete published tags.

## License

MIT for everything in this repo unless a specific file says otherwise. By contributing you agree that your contribution is licensed under the same.

## Skill frontmatter limits

Every `skills/**/SKILL.md` follows the Open Agent Skills contract: `name` is kebab-case and at most 64 characters; `description` is one dense paragraph of at most **1,024 characters** (hosts such as Pi warn or refuse beyond that). Keep the description to the routing summary and put the full trigger catalogue in the body (`## Activation` / `## When it fires`). `scripts/validate-frontmatter.py` fails CI on either overrun and prints the measured length.

## Marketplace rename decision log

1. **v1.0.0 – v1.2.0:** initial `name: 'AI PR Reviewer'` (slug `ai-pr-reviewer`, repo `DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer`) — assumed free based on Marketplace search.
2. **v1.2.1:** first publish attempt failed. Misdiagnosed the collision (thought it was against the `ai-pull-request-reviewer` full-form slug owned by `appchoose/ai-pr-review`), set defensive `name: 'Dailybot AI PR Reviewer'` (slug `dailybot-ai-pr-reviewer`) as a vendor-prefix workaround.
3. **v1.3.0:** re-checked Marketplace listing search — `ai-pr-reviewer` appeared free among Marketplace slugs. Reverted the prefix to `'AI PR Reviewer'` for cleaner OSS-community positioning. Repo still `DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer`.
4. **v1.5.0 (current, 2026-07-14):** second publish attempt failed with the correct diagnosis this time — GitHub's Marketplace name-uniqueness rule includes `user or organization name`, and the org `github.com/ai-pr-reviewer` (created 2024-01-12, 0 public repos, name-squatting) blocks the slug at the org-namespace level, not the Marketplace-listing level. Two coordinated renames:
   - **`action.yml` `name:`** — `'AI PR Reviewer'` → `'AI Diff Reviewer'` (slug `ai-diff-reviewer`, verified free at both the Marketplace and org-namespace levels).
   - **GitHub repo** — `DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer` → `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer`. So the repo slug now matches the Marketplace slug exactly. GitHub's permanent 301 redirect on renamed repos keeps `uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1` pins working for all existing consumers — no migration required.
   - Rationale for the specific name: "AI Diff Reviewer" is more accurate than "AI PR Reviewer" — this action reviews the `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` specifically, not the PR envelope (labels, description, metadata). The vendor prefix stays OFF: attribution is auto-rendered by GitHub via `author: DailybotHQ` in the listing footer, and OSS positioning is stronger without a brand prefix.
