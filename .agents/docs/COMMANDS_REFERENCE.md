# Commands Reference

Every `.md` file in `.agents/commands/` becomes a slash command. The full set, with what each does and where the procedure lives.

In Claude Code, type `/<name>`. In Codex / Cursor / Gemini, type `#<name>` (or whatever the agent's prefix is).

| `/dwp-status` | Report progress on a plan without making changes. | [commands/dwp-status.md](../commands/dwp-status.md) → [skills/deepworkplan/status](../skills/deepworkplan/status/SKILL.md) |
| `/dwp-verify` | Emit a CONFORMANT / NOT CONFORMANT verdict against the DWP spec. | [commands/dwp-verify.md](../commands/dwp-verify.md) → [skills/deepworkplan/verify](../skills/deepworkplan/verify/SKILL.md) |
| `/dwp-upgrade` | Check for a newer DeepWorkPlan skill; read-only until consent, then installs the accepted tag and re-onboards. | [commands/dwp-upgrade.md](../commands/dwp-upgrade.md) → [skills/deepworkplan/upgrade](../skills/deepworkplan/upgrade/SKILL.md) |
| `/skill-create` | Author or update a reusable skill under `.agents/skills/`. | [commands/skill-create.md](../commands/skill-create.md) → [skills/deepworkplan/author](../skills/deepworkplan/author/SKILL.md) |
| `/agent-create` | Author or update a sub-agent persona under `.agents/agents/`. | [commands/agent-create.md](../commands/agent-create.md) → [skills/deepworkplan/author](../skills/deepworkplan/author/SKILL.md) |

## How commands map to skills

Some commands are pure procedures (no skill backing) — for example `/commit` and `/branch`, which generate text and don't require multi-file orchestration. Others (`/release`, `/prompt-test`, `/add-provider`) are thin wrappers that read the corresponding skill's `SKILL.md` and follow its steps. The split is:

- **Pure command** — single procedure, ~50 lines or less, no shared logic with other commands. Lives in `commands/`.
- **Skill-backed command** — multi-step workflow, file-touching, shared logic (e.g. validation pre-flight). Logic lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; the command file is a one-line pointer.

When in doubt, write it as a pure command first. Promote to a skill if the procedure grows past ~50 lines or starts duplicating logic with another command.

## Adding a new command

1. Create `.agents/commands/<name>.md`. Use the existing files as templates. Frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   description: <one-line description>
   ---
   ```

2. Write the procedure inline. If it's >50 lines, factor it into a skill at `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and have the command file just point at it.
3. Add a row to the table above.
4. Add a row to the table in [skills_agents_catalog.md](skills_agents_catalog.md).
5. PR with the new command.

## Reserved names

Don't shadow Claude Code's built-in commands (`/help`, `/clear`, `/config`, `/agents`, `/skills`, `/cost`, `/init`, etc.). The names below are project-specific and safe.

## Style for command procedures

- **Lead with the steps**, not the philosophy. The agent invoking this needs to *do* something; explain why later if needed.
- **Use numbered steps** for sequences and checklists for verifications.
- **Show concrete commands** — the actual `git`, `gh`, `python3` invocation, not pseudocode.
- **Include pre-flight checks** — the things that should be true before the procedure starts.
- **Include failure modes** at the bottom — what can go wrong and how to recover.
