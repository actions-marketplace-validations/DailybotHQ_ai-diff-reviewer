# Review overrides for ai-diff-reviewer

This repo IS the AI Diff Reviewer — a stdlib-only Python composite GitHub
Action (`scripts/reviewer.py`, ~10k LOC in one file) that ships to a global
audience via the GitHub Marketplace. Every finding here is high-stakes:
runtime changes affect thousands of PRs; contract changes break consumers;
security regressions leak tokens on public runners. Calibrate accordingly.

The load-bearing rules live in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); this file
overrides the base prompt for the patterns most likely to slip a review.

## Severity overrides for this codebase

- **Always `critical`:** any non-stdlib `import` added to
  `scripts/reviewer.py` (Rule #2 — the load-bearing constraint that lets
  the action stay a zero-install composite). `requests`, `httpx`,
  `pyyaml`, `pydantic`, `click`, `tenacity`, `loguru` — all rejected. Use
  `urllib.request`, `dataclasses`, `argparse`-via-env-vars, hand-rolled
  retry loops.
- **Always `critical`:** any `subprocess.run(..., shell=True)` anywhere in
  `scripts/`. Argv-list form only — see `docs/SECURITY.md § "Subprocess
  argument injection protection"`. `_invoke_cli_agent()` and `run_cmd()`
  are the codified helpers; do not hand-roll a `subprocess.run` for a new
  CLI or command.
- **Always `critical`:** any tool taking a path argument (`tool_read_file`,
  `tool_grep`, new tools) that does not route through `safe_repo_path()`.
  Bypassing it opens path traversal (`../../etc/passwd`), absolute-path
  reads, and symlink escapes on the runner.
- **Always `critical`:** a new `AIPRR_*` env var forwarded into a vendor
  CLI subprocess without being added to `_CLI_ENV_ALLOWLIST` in
  `_build_cli_env()`. The scrub is the reason `AIPRR_GH_TOKEN` doesn't
  leak to Claude Code / Cursor / Codex; adding a var without allowlisting
  breaks that boundary silently.
- **Always `critical`:** removal or rename of any `action.yml` input or
  output (Rule #4 — public contract). Same for the moving major tag of
  the current line (`v2`). Breaking these needs a coordinated
  `v3.0.0` bump. Adding a new **optional** input is fine.
- **Always `critical`:** rename of any HTML marker string:
  `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->`, `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-state: … -->`,
  `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-provider:… -->`,
  `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-description-autocompleted -->`. These are stable
  contracts on **already-posted** PR comments across every consumer repo;
  renaming silently breaks `collapse-previous` and idempotency
  (`docs/STANDARDS.md § "Marker constants"`).
- **Always `critical`:** any backend URL built outside
  `resolve_endpoint_profile()` / `EndpointProfile.base_url` — a provider
  that concatenates its own host, reads `AIPRR_API_BASE` directly, or
  skips `validate_api_base()` breaks the "the key goes to exactly one
  configured host" guarantee (`docs/SECURITY.md § "Custom endpoints"`).
- **Always `critical`:** a new credential-bearing value (API key, OAuth
  token, bearer for a gateway) that is not passed through
  `register_secret()` before any text can reach a PR body, or a new
  subprocess `extra_vars` entry carrying a credential under a name the
  runner does not need.
- **Always `critical`:** a temp file that holds a prompt, a config with a
  base URL, or a credential (`auth.json`, `config.toml`, `prompt.md`)
  that is not created inside a `tempfile.mkdtemp()` directory, chmod'ed
  `0o600`, and removed in a `finally` block.
- **Always `critical`:** any `print(os.environ["AIPRR_API_KEY"])` /
  `log(f"key={api_key}")` / logging path that echoes an env var matching
  the redaction substrings (`token`, `key`, `secret`, `password`,
  `auth`). Use `redact_for_log()` for tool-arg logging;
  `register_secret` + `scrub_secrets` are the outbound gate for anything
  posted to a PR body.

- **Always `warning`:** a parser over vendor stdout / a vendor-written
  file (`_scan_json_lines`, `parse_*_usage`, `parse_findings_file`) that
  reads or scans without a byte cap (`CLI_STDOUT_SCAN_MAX_BYTES`,
  `MAX_FINDINGS_FILE_BYTES`), or a consumer-supplied pattern
  (`ignore-paths`) matched with a backtracking regex instead of the
  segment-DP `_GlobMatcher` (`fnmatch.translate` has the same ReDoS) —
  hostile output must not be able to exhaust memory or CPU on the runner.
- **Always `warning`:** missing type hints on new function signatures in
  `scripts/**.py` (Rule #3, `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md § "Type hints
  (mandatory)"`). Includes parameters, return type, and meaningful local
  variables. Modern syntax: `dict[str, Any]` not `Dict`, `list[X] | None`
  not `Optional[List[X]]`.
- **Always `warning`:** `except Exception` in `scripts/reviewer.py`
  without both `# noqa: BLE001` AND an inline comment explaining WHY.
  Three approved patterns only: "best-effort GH API call, never blocks
  the review", "surface to model rather than crash", "wrap loop so
  failures hit the spinner". Any other broad except is either mis-scoped
  (should be narrower) or a bug hiding in noise.
- **Always `warning`:** a magic number or magic string inlined into
  `scripts/reviewer.py` when it has meaning (a timeout, a cap, a
  severity name, an API URL, a marker template). Promote to a module-level
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constant at the top of the file — see the
  Constants section for the canonical shape.
- **Always `warning`:** a change to `action.yml` inputs/outputs that
  isn't mirrored in ALL of: `README.md` inputs table, `CHANGELOG.md`
  `[Unreleased]`, `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md`, at least
  one file under `examples/`. The setup skill's reference is the local
  companion's manual — drift makes the "any agent can answer setup
  questions" promise silently false (AGENTS.md Rule #7).
- **Always `warning`:** hand-edit of `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/**`
  on a feature branch. That directory is the vendored released version;
  it's refreshed automatically by `auto-release.yml` Step 3.5 after each
  tag. Work on `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/**` (the source-of-truth).
  See AGENTS.md Rule #10 pillar (B) and DON'T #14.
- **Always `warning`:** any new step in `.github/workflows/*.yml` that
  pipes attacker-controlled PR content (`title`, `body`, `pull_request.*`)
  into a shell command via `${{ ... }}` interpolation — that's remote
  code execution on the runner. Use `env:` mapping instead
  (`actionlint SC2086` guidance).

- **Escalate to `warning`:** Spanish or any non-English text in code,
  comments, docstrings, docs, PR titles/bodies, or commit messages
  (Rule #1 — global audience). The base prompt might treat this as
  `info`-level style; in this repo it's a usability regression.
- **Escalate to `warning`:** an increase of `MAX_TURNS`,
  `MAX_INLINE_COMMENTS`, `MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_BYTES`, or any cap in
  `scripts/reviewer.py` without a cost-per-review estimate in the PR
  description. These caps are billing decisions for every consumer.

- **De-escalate to `info`:** `scripts/reviewer.py` line count creeping
  past the historical ~4500 LOC soft ceiling (`docs/STANDARDS.md § "File size"` — the split is a scheduled decision, not a per-PR blocker).
  The ceiling is a prompt for a "should we split" conversation, not a
  merge blocker. Same for test files past 500 LOC.
- **De-escalate to `info`:** the byte-copy of `prompts/default.md` at
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md` — CI enforces they're identical
  (`code_check.yml § "Skills — prompt-sync invariant"`), so this is not
  dead code duplication.

## Don't comment on

- Missing unit tests for code that exercises live LLM provider APIs
  (Anthropic / Claude Code / Cursor / Codex). The strategy is dogfooding
  via `self-review.yml` + `cli-install-smoke`, not mocking every network
  boundary — see `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md § "Test discipline"`
  ("Don't mock external APIs end-to-end").
- Absence of `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` /
  `Pipfile` / virtualenv. The stdlib-only stance is the deliberate
  competitive moat (Rule #2 / `docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md`).
- Absence of `pytest`, `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, or any third-party tool
  in `.github/workflows/code_check.yml`. Stdlib `unittest` + `py_compile`
  + `actionlint` are the deliberate CI set.
- `# noqa: BLE001` **when accompanied by** an inline WHY comment
  matching one of the three codified patterns. That combination is
  intentional and load-bearing (`docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md § "Error
  handling"`); flagging it is false-positive noise.
- Formatting or whitespace in `.claude/**` or `CLAUDE.md` — those are
  symlinks. Any content edit belongs at `.agents/**` and `AGENTS.md`
  (Rule #12 / DON'T #12). If the diff touches the symlink target
  itself, that IS the bug worth flagging.
- The `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->`-family HTML strings appearing
  verbatim in `scripts/reviewer.py` and tests. Preserved across the
  v1.5.0 rename on purpose (Rule #9) for back-compat with existing PR
  comments; not stale copy.

## Repo-specific conventions

- **Subprocess:** use `run_cmd()` for internal commands (git, etc.) or
  `_invoke_cli_agent()` for vendor CLIs. `shell=False` always; never
  string-interpolate a user-controlled value into a command.
  `shlex.split()` on any user-provided arg string (`agent-extra-args`).
- **Paths:** any model-supplied or user-supplied path routes through
  `safe_repo_path(repo_root, candidate)`. Direct `Path.resolve()` on
  attacker-influenced input is a bug.
- **Env vars for the CLI subprocess:** only `_CLI_ENV_ALLOWLIST` entries
  are forwarded. Adding a variable requires an inline comment explaining
  why it's safe to hand to a third-party binary.
- **Logging:** use the `log(msg)` helper — writes to stdout with a
  `[ai-diff-reviewer]` prefix. Don't `print()` directly; don't
  `import logging`. Never log the value of any env var whose key matches
  the redaction substring list.
- **Constants at the top:** module-level `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Examples
  already codified: `MAX_TOOL_OUTPUT_BYTES: int = 32_000`,
  `DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS: int = 30`, `SEVERITY_CRITICAL: str = "critical"`.
  Full annotation is mandatory even on the LHS.
- **Action outputs:** use `write_action_output(name, value)` for any new
  value consumers should read in a downstream workflow step. Direct
  `print(f"::set-output ...")` is deprecated and not the pattern here.
- **Commit format:** Conventional Commits with body structure
  `## Summary / ## Change Log / ## Risks` — the same shape the PR
  description should follow (`docs/STANDARDS.md § "Commits"`).
- **Branding:** the product name is exactly **"AI Diff Reviewer"** in
  user-facing copy; slug is `ai-diff-reviewer`; env prefix is `AIPRR_`.
  Do not introduce variants ("AI-Diff-Reviewer", "AIDR", "AI PR
  Reviewer") — Rule #13.
- **Symlinks:** `.claude/` → `.agents/`, `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`.
  Never create a real file at `.claude/foo` or edit `CLAUDE.md`
  directly — edit the canonical.

## Test-strategy expectations

- New pure-logic function in `scripts/reviewer.py` → matching case in
  `tests/test_reviewer.py` (stdlib `unittest`, no `pytest`).
- New tool implementation (`tool_foo`) → `ToolFooTests` class following
  the existing pattern in `tests/test_reviewer.py`.
- New agent-runner provider or CLI helper (`_invoke_cli_agent`,
  `_build_cli_env`) → cases in `tests/test_agent_runner_providers.py`,
  including the subprocess-security invariants
  (`shell=False`, env allowlist).
- New findings-file parsing → cases in `tests/test_findings_parser.py`.
- Split at ~500 LOC per test file rather than growing an existing one
  past that (the concern-scoped split in `tests/` is the codified model).
- Any change to the agentic loop, `prompts/default.md`, or the
  review-submission path MUST be verified by `self-review.yml` on the
  PR (Rule #10 pillar A). If it can't (e.g. only fires on
  `block-on-warning`), describe the manual verification in the PR body.

## Security audit alignment (skills.sh + GitHub Marketplace)

Two external security surfaces must stay green: (1) [skills.sh
badges](https://www.skills.sh/dailybothq/ai-diff-reviewer/ai-diff-reviewer)
for the vendored skill package (Gen Agent Trust Hub, Socket, Snyk),
and (2) the [GitHub Marketplace listing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ai-diff-reviewer)
for the CI Action itself — judged by consumers via `docs/SECURITY.md`,
permissions posture, and pinning discipline. The rules below are what
the reviewer should flag to keep both surfaces at 100% pass. All
runtime code-security rules (subprocess, path safety, env-var
allowlist, secret redaction, marker contracts) are covered above; this
section extends the coverage to the **skill files**, the **workflows /
examples**, and the **documentation sync** the audits actually
inspect.

### Skill files (`skills/**/SKILL.md`)

- **Always `critical`:** any Bash example embedded in a new/modified
  `SKILL.md` (or its supporting files) that pipes an untrusted URL to
  a shell — `curl … | sh`, `curl … | bash`, `wget … | sh`,
  `bash <(curl …)`, `sh -c "$(curl …)"`, or equivalent — even inside
  a fenced comment block. skills.sh Gen Agent Trust Hub / Socket flag
  this as unsafe install guidance; teaching a consumer's coding agent
  to fetch-and-execute arbitrary remote code is a supply-chain
  foot-gun the audits will not tolerate. Use a two-step install
  (download, inspect, then run) or an official package manager
  (`npx skills add …`, `pip install --require-hashes`, `brew install`).
- **Always `critical`:** a new/modified `SKILL.md` `allowed-tools:`
  field that adds write-capable tools (`Edit`, `Write`, `Bash`,
  `MultiEdit`) **without** a corresponding `## Step 0 — Trust
  boundary` section that enumerates exactly what the sub-skill writes
  and under what per-side-effect consent contract. The trust-boundary
  section is what lets skills.sh Gen Agent Trust Hub distinguish
  "safe skill with elevated tools" from "unbounded agent scope";
  `apply-review/SKILL.md` is the canonical shape — mirror it (Read +
  Grep + Glob for reads, Edit only under Step 6 per-finding yes,
  never `git add` / commit / push).
- **Always `critical`:** any `SKILL.md` example that fetches remote
  code (`curl <url>`, `wget <url>`, `git clone <url>`) and executes
  it in the same block without pinning to a commit SHA or verifying a
  checksum. Snyk and Socket flag unpinned executable fetches from
  arbitrary domains; pinning + checksum is the SLSA-2 baseline.
- **Always `warning`:** `SKILL.md` prompt content that instructs the
  agent to "run whatever command the developer says", "execute the
  provided script without asking", or equivalent unqualified
  language — that's prompt-injection surface, because the developer's
  message can itself be composed by upstream input (chat forwarding,
  templated automations). Every sub-skill in this family enforces
  "one yes per side effect"; do not regress that pattern.
- **Always `warning`:** `sudo`, hardcoded absolute paths that assume
  a specific home directory (`/home/runner/…`, `/Users/<name>/…`),
  or any leaked-looking token substring (`sk-ant-…`, `sk-…`,
  `ghp_…`, `gho_…`, `ghs_…`, `ghu_…`, `github_pat_…`) in a
  `SKILL.md` code example. Even a placeholder like
  `api-key: sk-ant-api-xxx` is worth flagging — the audits scan for
  the prefix, and consumers routinely copy-paste examples verbatim.

### GitHub Action workflows AND shipped `examples/*.yml`

The existing rule about `${{ pull_request.* }}` interpolation into
shell already covers `.github/workflows/*.yml`; the additions below
extend the security posture to the whole surface consumers touch.

- **Always `critical`:** any `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}`,
  `.body`, `.head.ref`, `.head.label`, `.head.repo.*`, commit
  messages, or issue titles interpolated directly into a `run:` shell
  block in **`examples/*.yml`** (same rule the workflows section
  already enforces, extended here). Snippets in `examples/` are
  copy-pasted into consumer repos; if the example ships with the
  RCE-shaped pattern, every consumer inherits it. Use the `env:`
  mapping pattern instead: assign the value to an env var, then
  reference `"$VAR"` in the script.
- **Always `critical`:** any new/modified workflow using the
  `pull_request_target` event. This event runs with base-branch
  secrets and a full write token; combined with `actions/checkout@vN`
  on `github.head_ref` it is the most-exploited RCE pattern on GitHub
  Actions. This repo's [`docs/SECURITY.md` → *Agent-runner providers:
  residual exfiltration surface*](docs/SECURITY.md#agent-runner-providers-residual-exfiltration-surface-read-before-enabling)
  codifies the position in that section's mitigation bullets:
  **never use `pull_request_target` with an agent-runner provider**,
  and gate untrusted checkouts with
  `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`.
  Cite that section anchor rather than raw line numbers — the
  numbering drifts on the next SECURITY.md edit; the anchor is
  stable. If a new workflow genuinely needs `pull_request_target`
  (e.g. to label PRs from forks), flag it and require an inline
  justification comment naming exactly which secret/write-scope step
  runs before the untrusted checkout and how it is guarded.
- **Always `critical`:** a new/modified workflow job missing an
  explicit `permissions:` block. Default token permissions from the
  repo settings may still be `write-all`; explicit
  `permissions: { contents: read, pull-requests: write }` (or
  narrower per job) is the least-privilege posture the Marketplace
  listing implicitly promises consumers.
- **Always `warning`:** a new/modified workflow using a **third-party**
  action (i.e. not `actions/*`, `github/*`, or `DailybotHQ/*`)
  pinned to a **tag** rather than a full commit SHA — `actions/checkout@v4`
  is fine (first-party); `some-org/some-action@v1` is not (use
  `some-org/some-action@abcdef123…  # v1.2.3` with the tag as a
  trailing comment). Tags are mutable; SHAs are not. This is the
  SLSA-2 boundary and matches Dependabot's SHA-with-comment
  behaviour on `github-actions` ecosystem bumps.
- **Always `warning`:** `actions/checkout@vN` on `pull_request_target`
  or on any workflow that runs untrusted (fork) code without
  `with: { persist-credentials: false }`. The default persists the
  GitHub token in the git config, which arbitrary code in the
  checked-out branch can then exfiltrate. This is table stakes for
  any Action the Marketplace lists.
- **Always `warning`:** a workflow `env:` block that names a secret
  (`FOO: ${{ secrets.FOO }}`) whose value could reach a `run: echo …`
  path, workflow log, or artifact upload without going through
  `::add-mask::`. Prefer `echo "::add-mask::$FOO"` before the first
  reference AND avoid echoing the raw value at all.
- **Always `warning`:** a new `curl`/`wget` in a workflow step
  fetching from a domain **not** in the trust set (`github.com`,
  `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`,
  `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org`,
  `cli.dailybot.com`, `api.dailybot.com`). Add an inline
  justification comment naming why the domain is safe, or route
  through an official package manager. Supply-chain scanners flag
  unknown-domain fetches.

### Documentation sync with the audits

- **Always `warning`:** a change to `action.yml` that adds a new
  input carrying attacker-influenced data (new path, new URL, new
  command flag forwarded to a CLI, new webhook payload field) without
  a corresponding update to `docs/SECURITY.md` describing the new
  attack surface and its mitigation. The Marketplace listing links
  directly to `docs/SECURITY.md`; drift here is a public-facing
  security regression.
- **Always `warning`:** any addition to `.github/workflows/*.yml` (a
  new workflow file, not just a new step) without a matching entry in
  `.github/dependabot.yml`'s `github-actions` package-ecosystem
  section. Dependabot only bumps action pins on workflow files it
  knows about; a workflow it doesn't see silently rots and its
  third-party actions stay unpatched.

## Iteration-Aware Review (IAR) conventions

The IAR subsystem runs on every review and is load-bearing: every
consumer inherits the exact behavior contracts documented in
[`docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md`](../docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md). The
pipeline is wrapped in `try/except` at each `main()` touchpoint so an
IAR failure degrades to the baseline review path — the safety contract
is locked by `tests/test_iar_failure_fallback.py`. These rules protect
both contracts across future PRs.

- **Always `critical`:** removal or rename of any of the 4 IAR inputs
  (`convergence-policy`, `max-review-rounds`,
  `exhaustive-first-pass-cap-multiplier`, `iteration-escape-label`) or
  any of the 5 IAR outputs (`iteration-round`, `iteration-generation`,
  `iteration-policy-applied`, `iteration-tokens-used`,
  `iteration-cost-vs-baseline-estimate`). Public contract — same rule
  as Rule #4 applies (v2.0.0 required).
- **Always `critical`:** moving, weakening, or making configurable the
  hardcoded critical-always-surfaces branch in
  `dedupe_findings_against_prior()` (`scripts/reviewer.py`,
  docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.1). Every convergence policy funnels
  through this function precisely so the rail cannot be bypassed. A
  code review that lets a `severity == critical` finding be silenced
  by any policy or configuration is a correctness bug, not a
  refactor.
- **Always `critical`:** raising the default of `max_tokens` or
  `MAX_TURNS` under the banner of "IAR tuning". IAR's only cap knob
  is `max-inline-comments` and only on round 1 of a new generation.
  Per AGENTS.md DON'T #9, other budget defaults require a documented
  cost-per-review impact analysis first.
- **Always `warning`:** removing or weakening the `try/except` safety
  wrap around either `run_iar_pre_llm()` or `run_iar_post_llm()` in
  `main()`. The regression suite `tests/test_iar_failure_fallback.py`
  guards the invariant that an IAR failure MUST NOT crash the run;
  any change that regresses it must be explicitly justified in the
  PR body.
- **Always `warning`:** a new IAR helper that reads or writes network
  I/O outside `try/except` at the `main()` call site. IAR must NEVER
  crash the reviewer — every IAR failure path in `run_iar_pre_llm` /
  `run_iar_post_llm` falls back to the baseline review with empty
  IAR outputs.
- **Always `warning`:** a change to `IterationState` schema fields
  without a corresponding backward-compat parse test in
  `tests/test_iar_state_layer.py`. Older markers written by prior
  IAR versions must continue to parse — new fields default to
  `""` / `[]` / `0` as appropriate. Version-bump the
  `IAR_STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION` constant only for genuinely
  breaking changes (never in a `v1.x` release).
- **Always `warning`:** adding a new branch on `GenerationTransition`
  values (e.g. `if transition == GenerationTransition.NEW_COMMITS`)
  that does NOT explicitly consider `USER_FORCED_RESET`. The reset
  override sets `prior_state = None` AND changes the transition value,
  so most downstream code paths handle it correctly via the
  `prior_state is None` short-circuit — but any new code that dispatches
  on the transition enum without acknowledging `USER_FORCED_RESET`
  risks silently ignoring the reset semantics. Add a comment showing
  the reviewer considered it, or expand the branch to include it.
- **Always `critical`:** any change to the USER_FORCED_RESET detection
  in `run_iar_pre_llm` that removes or weakens EITHER of the two
  load-bearing safety guards: (i)
  `prior_state.reviewed_label_applied` — prevents any blocked-review
  re-trigger (which naturally has the reviewed label absent, because
  blocked runs never stamp it) from being misclassified as a
  deliberate reset — OR (ii) `label_fetch_ok` — prevents a transient
  GitHub 5xx returning an empty label list from being misread as
  "label absent" and silently wiping fingerprint memory on every
  outage (round-14 F1). All FIVE conditions — configured label,
  prior state, prior state records the label was stamped, label
  fetch succeeded, and label absent from the returned list — must
  remain conjoined.
- **Always `critical`:** any change to `_fetch_latest_marker_body` that
  removes the tier-2 fallback (minimized markers with an IAR state
  block). Without tier-2, `collapse-previous: true` (the shipped
  default) causes IAR to lose state on every run and treat every
  review as `first_review`. Any refactor MUST preserve the three-tier
  priority — see `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 7.3`.
- **Always `warning`:** any change to `dispatch_policy` that runs the
  escape-label short-circuit when `transition == USER_FORCED_RESET`.
  Reset is the stronger of the two exhaustive-triggering gestures
  (DISCARDS state vs. state-preserved for escape); when both are
  active the user's intent is "start clean" and the escape short-circuit
  MUST be skipped so the configured policy's exhaustive first-pass path
  fires. See `docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 8.5` precedence rules.
- **Always `critical`:** setting `IterationState.reviewed_label_applied`
  from anything other than the OBSERVED outcome of `gh_apply_label`
  (i.e., a local `label_stamped: bool` set to `True` only inside the
  try-block after the API call succeeds, `False` otherwise), OR
  omitting the assignment entirely, OR embedding the state block
  BEFORE the label-stamp attempt. The bit is the sole signal the
  next run has to distinguish "developer removed the reviewed label
  deliberately" from "reviewer never stamped it because the run was
  blocked or the stamp failed" — anything else races the label-stamp
  outcome against the state write and can silently wipe dedup memory
  on a network hiccup.
- **Always `critical`:** any change that truncates a `list[Finding]`
  against `effective_max_inline_comments` (or any cap) via a naive
  `findings[:cap]` without first sorting criticals-to-the-front via
  `_sort_findings_criticals_first`. The critical-always-surfaces
  safety rail (docs § 7.1) is hardcoded and non-configurable — a
  cap-drop that sheds a critical silently bypasses it. Both round-1
  exhaustive AND the agent-runner cap-enforce path currently obey
  this invariant; any new truncation site must too.
- **Always `warning`:** any change to `compute_generation_range_hash`
  or `compute_new_lines_pct` that swaps their three-dot diff spec
  (`base_sha...head_sha`) back to two-dot (`base_sha..head_sha`).
  Three-dot pins the comparison to the merge base — matching the
  PR-visible diff `fetch_pr_context` sends to the LLM. Two-dot
  recomputes the hash / percentage whenever `origin/<base>` moves
  upstream even though the PR content is unchanged, producing false
  `NEW_COMMITS` / `REBASED` transitions and inflating the
  safety-net denominator. See docs/ITERATION_AWARENESS.md § 4.3.
- **Always `warning`:** any refactor of `compute_reviewed_label_applied`
  that reduces the three-signal OR (`label_stamped OR
  label_currently_on_pr OR prior_bit`) to fewer inputs — or that
  changes the write site in `main()` to bypass this helper and set
  `iar_state_final.reviewed_label_applied` from a subset of the
  signals. Each signal is load-bearing per docs § 8.5: dropping
  `label_currently_on_pr` breaks the blocked-follow-up preservation
  case; dropping `prior_bit` breaks the escape-label path; dropping
  `label_stamped` breaks first-review arming. The helper is the
  single source of truth — the write site must call it.
- **Always `info`:** using the term "silence" for a finding IAR
  chose not to submit. The correct term is "dedup" or "silence"
  depending on the reason (dedup = the finding matches a prior
  fingerprint; silence = the policy chose to hide it). The
  `SilencedFinding.reason` field carries this distinction.

## Skip-review-label conventions

The `skip-review-label` input is an opt-in emergency-bypass hatch — when
BOTH the workflow trigger fires AND the configured label is on the PR,
`main()` short-circuits to success without invoking the LLM. It is a
security-sensitive surface (anyone who can label a PR can bypass code
review) so the rules below protect its invariants.

- **Always `critical`:** removal or rename of the `skip-review-label`
  input from `action.yml`, or of `AIPRR_SKIP_REVIEW_LABEL` from the
  env-var wire-up. Public contract — same rule as Rule #4 applies
  (v2.0.0 required).
- **Always `critical`:** any change that lets the skip path stamp the
  `applied-label` (the "reviewed" label). Applying it would
  misrepresent an unreviewed PR as reviewed and lie to every
  dashboard, ruleset, and reviewer downstream. The rule is unconditional.
- **Always `warning`:** any change that lets the skip path read or
  mutate IAR persisted state (marker parse, `read_prior_iteration_state`,
  `write_iteration_state`, `advance_generation`, etc.). The skip must
  leave IAR exactly as it was — the next non-skip run resumes from
  where the pipeline last left off.
- **Always `warning`:** any change that moves the skip short-circuit
  AFTER a network-side-effecting step (collapse-previous, tracking
  spinner post, PR context fetch, LLM invocation). The skip is meant
  to be minimal — anything the reviewer did BEFORE the short-circuit
  fires becomes a broken invariant.
- **Always `warning`:** removing the `REVIEW_MARKER` (or the
  per-provider marker) from `render_tracking_body_skipped_by_label`.
  Both are needed for `collapse-previous` on the next real run to
  recognise the skip comment as a prior bot artefact and minimise it.
- **Always `info`:** using the word "blocked" or "failed" in
  documentation for what a skip does. The correct terms are
  "skipped", "bypassed", or "short-circuited" — the skip is a success
  path from GitHub's perspective, not a failure or block.

## PR hygiene

- When complexity labeling is enabled (`complexity-labels-enabled`):
  - **Chat-completions** (`anthropic`): call `set_pr_complexity` once before
    `submit_review`.
  - **Agent-runner** (`cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`): include
    `"complexity": "low|medium|high"` in `.aiprr/findings.json` (required).
  Even docs-only PRs get a level — typically `low`.
- PR title in Conventional Commits format (matches the squash-merge
  subject).
- PR body follows `## Summary / ## Change Log / ## Risks`.
- If `action.yml` changed → verify README's inputs table AND
  `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/setup/reference.md` are both updated in the
  same PR.
- If `prompts/default.md` changed → link before/after review evidence on
  a real PR (Rule #7 / DON'T #6).
- If any skill under `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/**` changed → do NOT also
  edit the vendored `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/**`; Step 3.5 of
  auto-release handles it (Rule #10 pillar B).
